##### Essential quantities
## Define the data

s1minsnps:5000
s1indfrac:0.1
indsperproc:10 # inds processed per file for phase2 (used for phase1 unless we have to process each individual separately for CPU saving via p1minsnps or p1indfrac)

s3iters:1000000 # number of MCMC iterations (burnin + sampling)
s4iters:10000 # number of Tree iterations
