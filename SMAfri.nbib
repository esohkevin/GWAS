TI  - Malaria severity: Possible influence of the E670G PCSK9 polymorphism: A
      preliminary case-control study in Malian children.
PG  - e0192850
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0192850 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) is a hepatic secretory
      protein which promotes the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors
      leading to reduced hepatic uptake of plasma cholesterol. Non-synonymous
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in its gene have been linked to hypo- or hyper-
      cholesterolemia, depending on whether they decrease or increase PCSK9 activity,
      respectively. Since the proliferation and the infectivity of Plasmodium spp.
      partially depend on cholesterol from the host, we hypothesize that these PCSK9
      genetic polymorphisms could influence the course of malaria infection in
      individuals who carry them. Here we examined the frequency distribution of one
      dominant (C679X) and two recessive (A443T, I474V) hypocholesterolemic
      polymorphisms as well as that of one recessive hypercholesterolemic polymorphism 
      (E670G) among healthy and malaria-infected Malian children. METHODS: Dried blood 
      spots were collected in Bandiagara, Mali, from 752 age, residence and
      ethnicity-matched children: 253 healthy controls, 246 uncomplicated malaria
      patients and 253 severe malaria patients. Their genomic DNA was extracted and
      genotyped for the above PCSK9 polymorphisms using Taqman assays. Associations of 
      genotype distributions and allele frequencies with malaria were evaluated.
      RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of the A443T, I474V, E670G, and C679X
      polymorphisms in the study population sample was 0.12, 0.20, 0.26, and 0.02,
      respectively. For each polymorphism, the genotype distribution among the three
      health conditions was statistically insignificant, but for the
      hypercholesterolemic E670G polymorphism, a trend towards association of the minor
      allele with malaria severity was observed (P = 0.035). The association proved to 
      be stronger when allele frequencies between healthy controls and severe malaria
      cases were compared (Odd Ratio: 1.34; 95% Confidence Intervals: 1.04-1.83); P =
      0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the minor allele of the E670G PCSK9 polymorphism
      might be more susceptible to severe malaria. Further investigation of the
      cholesterol regulating function of PCSK9 in the pathophysiology of malaria is
      needed.

      pressure in North-eastern Tanzania.

AB  - Significant selection pressure has been exerted on the genomes of human
      populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection, resulting in the
      acquisition of mechanisms of resistance against severe malarial disease. Many
      host genetic factors, including sickle cell trait, have been associated with
      reduced risk of developing severe malaria, but do not account for all of the
      observed phenotypic variation. Identification of novel inherited risk factors
      relies upon high-resolution genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present
      findings of a GWAS of severe malaria performed in a Tanzanian population (n =
      914, 15.2 million SNPs). Beyond the expected association with the sickle cell HbS
      variant, we identify protective associations within two interleukin receptors
      (IL-23R and IL-12RBR2) and the kelch-like protein KLHL3 (all P<10-6), as well as 
      near significant effects for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes.
      Complementary analyses, based on detecting extended haplotype homozygosity,
      identified SYNJ2BP, GCLC and MHC as potential loci under recent positive
      selection. Through whole genome sequencing of an independent Tanzanian cohort
      (parent-child trios n = 247), we confirm the allele frequencies of common
      polymorphisms underlying associations and selection, as well as the presence of
      multiple structural variants that could be in linkage with these SNPs. Imputation
      of structural variants in a region encompassing the glycophorin genes on
      chromosome 4, led to the characterisation of more than 50 rare variants, and
      individually no strong evidence of associations with severe malaria in our
      primary dataset (P>0.3). Our approach demonstrates the potential of a joint
      genotyping-sequencing strategy to identify as-yet unknown susceptibility loci in 
      an African population with well-characterised malaria phenotypes. The regions
      encompassing these loci are potential targets for the design of much needed
      interventions for preventing or treating malarial disease.

AB  - A number of human genetic polymorphisms are prevalent in tropical populations and
      appear to offer protection against symptomatic and/or severe malaria. We compared
      the prevalence of four polymorphisms, the sickle hemoglobin mutation (beta globin
      E6V), the alpha-thalassemia 3.7kb deletion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
      deficiency caused by the common African variant (G6PD A-), and the CD36 T188G
      mutation in 1344 individuals residing in districts in eastern (Tororo),
      south-central (Jinja), and southwestern (Kanungu) Uganda. Genes of interest were 
      amplified, amplicons subjected to mutation-specific restriction endonuclease
      digestion (for sickle hemoglobin, G6PD A-, and CD36 T188G), reaction products
      resolved by electrophoresis, and genotypes determined based on the sizes of
      reaction products. Mutant genotypes were common, with many more heterozygous than
      homozygous alleles identified. The prevalences (heterozygotes plus homozygotes)
      of sickle hemoglobin (28% Tororo, 25% Jinja, 7% Kanungu), alpha-thalassemia (53% 
      Tororo, 45% Jinja, 18% Kanungu) and G6PD A- (29% Tororo, 18% Jinja, 8% Kanungu)
      were significantly greater in Tororo and Jinja compared to Kanungu (p<0.0001 for 
      all three alleles); prevalences were also significantly greater in Tororo
      compared to Jinja for alpha-thalassemia (p=0.03) and G6PD A- (p<0.0001). For the 
      CD36 T188G mutation, the prevalence was significantly greater in Tororo compared 
      to Jinja or Kanungu (27% Tororo, 17% Jinja, 18% Kanungu; p=0.0004 and 0.0017,
      respectively). Considering ethnicity of study subjects, based on primary language
      spoken, the prevalence of mutant genotypes was lower in Bantu compared to
      non-Bantu language speakers, but in the Jinja cohort, the only study population
      with a marked diversity of language groups, prevalence did not differ between
      Bantu and non-Bantu speakers. These results indicate marked differences in human 
      genetic features between populations in different regions of Uganda. These
      differences might be explained by both ethnic variation and by varied malaria
      risk in different regions of Uganda.

AB  - Several studies have provided evidence of both helpful and harmful effects of TNF
      on the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection. Several TNF
      polymorphisms that are located within non-coding regions have been associated
      with parasitaemia, mild malaria or severe malaria. We investigated the
      association of TNF1304 (rs3093664), TNF-308 (rs1800629), TNF-238 (rs361525) and
      TNF-244 (rs673) with mild malaria and symptomatic maximum parasitaemia in a
      population-based design (n=310). We obtained nominal evidence for an association 
      between symptomatic maximum parasitaemia and TNF-308, TNF-238, and TNF-244 on the
      one hand, and between the number of mild malaria attacks and TNF-244 on the other
      hand. After accounting for multiple tests, we confirmed the association of
      symptomatic maximum parasitaemia with TNF-244. We further provide bioinformatics 
      and experimental evidence that TNF-244 has a cis-regulatory effect. This is the
      first report that emphasizes the potential role of TNF-244 in malaria.

AB  - Genetic factors are associated with susceptibility to many infectious diseases
      and may be determinants of clinical progression. Gene copy number variation (CNV)
      has been shown to be associated with phenotypes of numerous diseases, including
      malaria. We quantified gene copy numbers of the pyruvate kinase, liver, and red
      blood cell (PKLR) gene as well as of the Fcgamma receptor 2A and Fcgamma receptor
      2C (FCGR2A, FCGR2C) and Fcgamma receptor 3 (FCGR3) genes using real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays in Gabonese children with
      severe (n = 184) or and mild (n = 189) malaria and in healthy Gabonese and white 
      individuals (n = 76 each). The means of PKLR, FCGR2A, FCGR2C, and FCGR3 copy
      numbers were significantly higher among children with severe malaria compared to 
      those with mild malaria (P < .002), indicating that a surplus of copies of those 
      genes is significantly associated with malaria severity. Copy numbers of the
      FCGR2A and FCGR2C genes were significantly lower (P = .005) in Gabonese
      individuals compared with white individuals. In conclusion, CNV of the PKLR,
      FCGR2A, FCGR2C, and FCGR3 genes is associated with malaria severity, and our
      results provide evidence for a role of CNV in host responses to malaria.

TI  - Molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance in Central, West and East
      African children with severe malaria.
PG  - 217
LID - 10.1186/s12936-017-1868-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1), P.
      falciparum Ca(2+)-ATPase (PfATP6) and Kelch-13 propeller domain (PfK13) loci are 
      molecular markers of parasite susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs. Their
      frequency distributions were determined in the isolates collected from children
      with severe malaria originating from three African countries. METHODS: Samples
      from 287 children with severe malaria [(Gabon: n = 114); (Ghana: n = 89); (Kenya:
      n = 84)] were genotyped for pfmdr1, pfatp6 and pfk13 loci by DNA sequencing and
      assessing pfmdr1 copy number variation (CNV) by real-time PCR. RESULTS:
      Pfmdr1-N86Y mutation was detected in 48, 10 and 10% in Lambarene, Kumasi and
      Kisumu, respectively. At codon 184, the prevalence of the mutation was 73% in
      Lambarene, 63% in Kumasi and 49% Kisumu. The S1034C and N1042D variants were
      absent at all three sites, while the frequency of the D1246Y mutation was 1, 3
      and 13% in Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. Isolates with two pfmdr1
      gene copy number predominantly harboured the N86Y wild-type allele and were
      mostly found in Kumasi (10%) (P < 0.0001). Among the main pfmdr1 haplotypes (NFD,
      NYD and YFD), NYD was associated with highest parasitaemia (P = 0.04). At the
      pfatp6 locus, H243Y and A623E mutations were observed at very low frequency at
      all three sites. The prevalence of the pfatp6 E431K variant was 6, 18 and 17% in 
      Lambarene, Kumasi and Kisumu, respectively. The L263E and S769N mutations were
      absent in all isolates. The pfk13 variants associated with artemisinin resistance
      in Southeast Asia were not observed. Eleven novel substitutions in the pfk13
      locus occurring at low frequency were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinins are
      still highly efficacious in large malaria-endemic regions though declining
      efficacy has occurred in Southeast Asia. The return of chloroquine-sensitive
      strains following the removal of drug pressure is observed. However, selection of
      wild-type alleles in the multidrug-resistance gene and the increased gene copy
      number is associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity. This study indicates 
      a need to constantly monitor drug resistance to artemisinin in field isolates
      from malaria-endemic countries.

TI  - Resistance to malaria through structural variation of red blood cell invasion
      receptors.
LID - eaam6393 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/science.aam6393 [doi]
AB  - The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum invades human red blood cells by a
      series of interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. By analyzing
      genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 individuals from
      sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a diverse array of large copy-number variants
      affecting the host invasion receptor genes GYPA and GYPB We find that a nearby
      association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural
      rearrangement involving the loss of GYPB and gain of two GYPB-A hybrid genes,
      which encode a serologically distinct blood group antigen known as Dantu. This
      variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently increased in
      frequency in parts of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These 
      findings link structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors with
      natural resistance to severe malaria.

TI  - Absence of association between polymorphisms in the K13 gene and the presence of 
      Plasmodium falciparum parasites at day 3 after treatment with artemisinin
      derivatives in Senegal.

AB  - In 2006, the Senegalese National Malaria Control Programme recommended
      artemisinin-based combination therapy as first-line treatment for uncomplicated
      malaria. In addition, intravenous (i.v.) injection of artesunate and artemether
      has gradually replaced quinine for the treatment of severe malaria. Mutations in 
      the propeller domain of the Kelch 13 gene (K13-propeller, PF3D71343700), such as 
      Y493H, R539T, I543T and C580Y, were recently associated with in vivo and in vitro
      resistance to artemisinin in Southeast Asia. However, these mutations were not
      identified in Africa. In total, 181 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from 161
      patients from Dakar, Senegal, were collected between August 2015 and January
      2016. The K13-propeller gene of the isolates was sequenced. A search for
      non-synonymous mutations in the propeller region of K13 was performed in the 181 
      isolates collected from Dakar from 2015 to 2016. Three synonymous mutations were 
      detected (D464D, C469C and R471R). Of 119 patients treated with i.v. artesunate
      or intramuscular artemether followed by artemether/lumefantrine, 9 patients were 
      still parasitaemic on Day 3. Parasites from these nine patients were wild-type
      for K13-propeller. None of the polymorphisms known to be involved in artemisinin 
      resistance in Asia were detected. These results suggest that K13 is not the best 
      predictive marker for artemisinin resistance in Africa. More isolates from
      clinical failure cases or patients with delayed parasite clearance after
      treatment with artemisinin derivatives are necessary to identify new molecular
      markers.

TI  - Association between Fcgamma receptor IIA, IIIA and IIIB genetic polymorphisms and
      susceptibility to severe malaria anemia in children in western Kenya.
PG  - 289
LID - 10.1186/s12879-017-2390-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Naturally-acquired immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria develops
      after several episodes of infection. Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs) bind to
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and mediate phagocytosis of opsonized microbes,
      thereby, linking humoral and cellular immunity. FcgammaR polymorphisms influence 
      binding affinity to IgGs and consequently, can influence clinical malaria
      outcomes. Specifically, variations in FcgammaRIIA -131Arg/His,
      FcgammaRIIIA-176F/V and FcgammaRIIIB-NA1/NA2 modulate immune responses through
      altered binding preferences to IgGs and immune complexes. Differential binding,
      in turn, changes ability of immune cells to respond to infection through
      production of inflammatory mediators during P. falciparum infection. METHODS: We 
      determined the association between haplotypes of FcgammaRIIA-131Arg/His,
      FcgammaRIIIA-176F/V and FcgammaRIIIB-NA1/NA2 variants and severe malarial anemia 
      (SMA; hemoglobin < 6.0 g/dL, any density parasitemia) in children (n = 274; aged 
      6-36 months) presenting for their first hospital visit with P. falciparum malaria
      in a holoendemic transmission region of western Kenya. FcgammaRIIA-131Arg/His and
      FcgammaRIIIA-176F/V genotypes were determined using TaqMan(R) SNP genotyping,
      while FcgammaRIIIBNA1/NA2 genotypes were determined using restriction fragment
      length polymorphism. Hematological and parasitological indices were measured in
      all study participants. RESULTS: Carriage of
      FcgammaRIIA-131Arg/FcgammaRIIIA-176F/FcgammaRIIIBNA2 haplotype was associated
      with susceptibility to SMA (OR = 1.70; 95% CI; 1.02-2.93; P = 0.036), while the
      FcgammaRIIA-131His/ FcgammaRIIIA-176F/ FcgammaRIIIB NA1 haplotype was marginally 
      associated with enhanced susceptibility to SMA (OR: 1.80, 95% CI; 0.98-3.30, P = 
      0.057) and higher levels of parasitemia (P = 0.009). Individual genotypes of
      FcgammaRIIA-131Arg/His, FcgammaRIIIA-176F/V and FcgammaRIIIB-NA1/NA2 were not
      associated with susceptibility to SMA. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that
      haplotypes of FcgammaRs are important in conditioning susceptibility to SMA in
      immune-naive children from P. falciparum holoendemic region of western Kenya.

TI  - Haplotype of non-synonymous mutations within IL-23R is associated with
      susceptibility to severe malaria anemia in a P. falciparum holoendemic
      transmission area of Kenya.
PG  - 291
LID - 10.1186/s12879-017-2404-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
      pediatric severe malarial anemia (SMA) pathogenesis is a crucial step in the
      design of novel therapeutics. Identification of host genetic susceptibility
      factors in immune regulatory genes offers an important tool for deciphering
      malaria pathogenesis. The IL-23/IL-17 immune pathway is important for both
      immunity and erythropoiesis via its effects through IL-23 receptors (IL-23R).
      However, the impact of IL-23R variants on SMA has not been fully elucidated.
      METHODS: Since variation within the coding region of IL-23R may influence the
      pathogenesis of SMA, the association between IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T), rs7530511
      (C/T), and SMA (Hb < 6.0 g/dL) was examined in children (n = 369, aged 6-36
      months) with P. falciparum malaria in a holoendemic P. falciparum transmission
      area. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding factor
      of anemia, revealed that individual genotypes of IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T) [GT; OR =
      1.34, 95% CI = 0.78-2.31, P = 0.304 and TT; OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.53-7.74, P =
      0.286] and IL-23R rs7530511 (C/T) [CT; OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 0.59-11.86, P = 0.202
      and TT; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.84-3.27, P = 0.142] were not associated with
      susceptibility to SMA. However, carriage of IL-23R rs1884444T/rs7530511T (TT)
      haplotype, consisting of both mutant alleles, was associated with increased
      susceptibility to SMA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-4.19, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION:
      Results presented here demonstrate that a haplotype of non-synonymous IL-23R
      variants increase susceptibility to SMA in children of a holoendemic P.
      falciparum transmission area.

TI  - Lack of Association of CD55 Receptor Genetic Variants and Severe Malaria in
      Ghanaian Children.

AB  - In a recent report, the cellular receptor CD55 was identified as a molecule
      essential for the invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum, the
      causal agent of the most severe form of malaria. As this invasion process
      represents a critical step during infection with the parasite, it was
      hypothesized that genetic variants in the gene could affect severe malaria (SM)
      susceptibility. We performed high-resolution variant discovery of rare and common
      genetic variants in the human CD55 gene. Association testing of these variants in
      over 1700 SM cases and unaffected control individuals from the malaria-endemic
      Ashanti Region in Ghana, West Africa, were performed on the basis of single
      variants, combined rare variant analyses, and reconstructed haplotypes. A total
      of 26 genetic variants were detected in coding and regulatory regions of CD55
      Five variants were previously unknown. None of the single variants, rare
      variants, or haplotypes showed evidence for association with SM or P. falciparum 
      density. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of variation in the
      CD55 gene in the context of SM and show that genetic variants present in a
      Ghanaian study group appear not to influence susceptibility to the disease.

TI  - Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) and cytokine gene
      variants in complicated and uncomplicated malaria.
PG  - 1592-1601
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12787 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria elicits inflammatory responses, which, if not well regulated,
      may exert detrimental effects. When activated, triggering receptor expressed on
      myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) enhances inflammatory responses by increasing secretion 
      of IL-8 and other Th1 cytokines. In contrast, TREM-like transcript 1 (TREML-1)
      promotes anti-inflammatory responses by binding to TREM-1 ligands and competing
      with TREM-1, thus antagonizing TREM-1 activation to reduce inflammation.
      Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) also mediates anti-inflammatory responses
      by activating endothelial protein C (PC). Upon microbial stimulation, soluble
      forms of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and soluble EPCR (sEPCR) are released. Their plasma
      levels reflect the degree of inflammation and the severity of infection. METHODS:
      In a cross-sectional study comparing patients with severe with uncomplicated
      malaria, sTREM-1, soluble TREML-1 (sTREML-1) and sEPCR plasma levels as well as
      plasma levels of sEPCR derived from convalescent patients were quantified.
      Samples were collected on admittance of paediatric patients infected with
      Plasmodium falciparum to hospitals in Accra, Ghana. Distinct genetic regions of
      the genes encoding TREM-1, EPCR, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-18 encompassing known 
      genetic polymorphisms that influence plasma levels underwent DNA sequencing.
      RESULTS: Higher sTREM-1 levels were observed among children suffering from severe
      malaria compared to those with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.049). Low TREM-1 to
      TREML-1 ratios were associated with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.033). The TREM1 
      rs2234237T variant causing the amino acid exchange Thr25Ser, which has been
      associated with higher TREM-1 plasma levels, was significantly more frequent
      among patients with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria (P = 
      0.036). Low levels of sEPCR were observed in severe and uncomplicated malaria,
      while variant genotypes of IL8, IL18 and EPCR did not show any association.
      CONCLUSION: Higher plasma levels of sTREM-1 alone or relative to sTREML-1 during 
      malaria predispose to the phenotype of severe malaria. Carriage of the TREM1
      rs2234237T allele appears to be a risk factor for the development of severe
      malaria.

TI  - The endothelial protein C receptor rs867186-GG genotype is associated with
      increased soluble EPCR and could mediate protection against severe malaria.
PG  - 27084
LID - 10.1038/srep27084 [doi]
AB  - The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) appears to play an important role in
      Plasmodium falciparum endothelial cell binding in severe malaria (SM). Despite
      consistent findings of elevated soluble EPCR (sEPCR) in other infectious
      diseases, field studies to date have provided conflicting data about the role of 
      EPCR in SM. To better define this role, we performed genotyping for the
      rs867186-G variant, associated with increased sEPCR levels, and measured sEPCR
      levels in two prospective studies of Ugandan children designed to understand
      immunologic and genetic factors associated with neurocognitive deficits in SM
      including 551 SM children, 71 uncomplicated malaria (UM) and 172 healthy
      community children (CC). The rs867186-GG genotype was more frequent in CC (4.1%) 
      than SM (0.6%, P = 0.002). The rs867186-G variant was associated with increased
      sEPCR levels and sEPCR was lower in children with SM than CC (P < 0.001). Among
      SM children, those who had a second SM episode showed a trend toward lower plasma
      sEPCR both at initial admission and at 6-month follow-up compared to those
      without repeated SM (P = 0.06 for both). The study findings support a role for
      sEPCR in severe malaria pathogenesis and emphasize a distinct role of sEPCR in
      malaria as compared to other infectious diseases.

AB  - Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) - alpha has been shown to play an important role in 
      the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria. Two TNF promoter polymorphisms, TNF-308
      and TNF-238 have been associated with differential activity and production of
      TNF. In order to investigate the association between TNF-308 and TNF-238 and the 
      clinical outcome of malaria in a Nigerian population, the two TNF polymorphisms
      were analysed using Sequenom iPLEX Platform. A total of 782 children; 283
      children with uncomplicated malaria, 255 children with severe malaria and 244
      children with asymptomatic infection (controls) were studied. The distribution of
      TNF-308 and TNF-238 genotypes were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium. Distribution of both TNF polymorphisms differed significantly across
      all clinical groups (TNF-308: p=0.007; TNF-238: p=0.001). Further tests for
      association with severe malaria using genotype models controlling for age,
      parasitaemia and HbAS showed a significant association of the TNF-238
      polymorphism with susceptibility to severe malaria (95% CI=1.43-6.02, OR=2.94,
      p=0.003237) The GG genotype of TNF-238 significantly increased the risk of
      developing cerebral malaria from asymptomatic malaria and uncomplicated malaria
      (95% CI=1.99-18.17, OR=6.02, p<0.001 and 95% CI=1.78-8.23, OR=3.84, p<0.001
      respectively). No significant association was found between TNF-308 and malaria
      outcome. These results show thegenetic association of TNF-238 in the clinical
      outcome of malaria in Ibadan, southwest Nigeria. These findings add support to
      the role of TNF in the outcome of malaria infection. Further large scale studies 
      across multiple malaria endemic populations will be required to determine the
      specific roles of TNF-308 and TNF-238 in the outcome of falciparum malaria
      infection.

TI  - Heterogeneous alleles comprising G6PD deficiency trait in West Africa exert
      contrasting effects on two major clinical presentations of severe malaria.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1045-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency exhibits
      considerable allelic heterogeneity which manifests with variable biochemical and 
      clinical penetrance. It has long been thought that G6PD deficiency confers
      partial protection against severe malaria, however prior genetic association
      studies have disagreed with regard to the strength and specificity of a
      protective effect, which might reflect differences in the host genetic
      background, environmental influences, or in the specific clinical phenotypes
      considered. METHODS: A case-control association study of severe malaria was
      conducted in The Gambia, a region in West Africa where there is considerable
      allelic heterogeneity underlying expression of G6PD deficiency trait, evaluating 
      the three major nonsynonymous polymorphisms known to be associated with enzyme
      deficiency (A968G, T542A, and C202T) in a cohort of 3836 controls and 2379 severe
      malaria cases. RESULTS: Each deficiency allele exhibited a similar trend toward
      protection against severe malaria overall (15-26% reduced risk); however, in
      stratifying severe malaria to two of its constituent clinical subphenotypes,
      severe malarial anaemia (SMA) and cerebral malaria (CM), the three deficiency
      alleles exhibited trends of opposing effect, with risk conferred to SMA and
      protection with respect to CM. To assess the overall effect of G6PD deficiency
      trait, deficiency alleles found across all three loci were pooled. G6PD
      deficiency trait was found to be significantly associated with protection from
      severe malaria overall (OR 0.83 [0.75-0.92], P = 0.0006), but this was limited to
      CM (OR 0.73 [0.61-0.87], P = 0.0005), with a trend toward increased risk for SMA,
      especially in fully-deficient individuals (OR 1.43 [0.99-2.08], P = 0.056).
      Sex-stratified testing largely comported with these results, with evidence
      suggesting that protection by G6PD deficiency trait is conferred to both males
      and females, though susceptibility to SMA may be restricted to fully-deficient
      male hemizygotes. CONCLUSIONS: In a part of Africa where multiple alleles
      contribute to expression of G6PD deficiency trait, these findings clarify and
      extend previous work done in populations where a single variant predominates, and
      taken together suggest a causal role for G6PD deficiency trait itself with
      respect to severe malaria, with opposing effects seen on two major clinical
      subphenotypes.

TI  - Haplotypes of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) gene are not associated
      with severe malaria in Tanzania.
PG  - 474
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-1007-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was recently identified as a
      key receptor for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 mediating
      sequestration of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in patients suffering from
      severe malaria. Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) inhibits binding of P. falciparum to EPCR in
      vitro and increased levels of sEPCR have been associated with the H3 haplotype of
      the EPCR encoding PROCR gene. It has been hypothesized that elevated sEPCR
      levels, possibly linked to the PROCR H3 genetic variant, may confer protection
      against severe forms of malaria. This study determined the frequencies of PROCR
      haplotypes H1-4 and plasma levels of sEPCR in a Tanzanian study population to
      investigate a possible association with severe malaria. METHODS: Study
      participants were children under 5 years of age admitted at the Korogwe District 
      Hospital (N = 143), and diagnosed as having severe malaria (N = 52; including
      cerebral malaria N = 17), uncomplicated malaria (N = 24), or an infection other
      than malaria (N = 67). In addition, blood samples from 71 children living in
      nearby villages were included. The SNPs defining the haplotypes of PROCR gene
      were determined by post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere
      assay. RESULTS: Individuals carrying at least one H3 allele had significantly
      higher levels of sEPCR than individuals with no H3 alleles (P < 0.001). No
      difference in the frequency of H3 was found between the non-malaria patients,
      malaria patients or the village population (P > 0.1). Plasma levels of sEPCR
      differed between these three groups, with higher sEPCR levels in the village
      population compared to the hospitalized patients (P < 0.001) and higher levels in
      malaria patients compared to non-malaria patients (P = 0.001). However, no
      differences were found in the distribution of H3 (P = 0.2) or levels of sEPCR (P 
      = 0.8) between patients diagnosed with severe and uncomplicated malaria.
      CONCLUSION: Frequencies of SNPs determining PROCR haplotypes were in concordance 
      with other African studies. The PROCR H3 allele was associated with higher levels
      of sEPCR, confirming earlier findings, however, in this Tanzanian population;
      neither PROCR haplotype nor level of sEPCR was associated with severe malaria,
      however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - A novel locus of resistance to severe malaria in a region of ancient balancing
      selection.
PG  - 253-7
LID - 10.1038/nature15390 [doi]
AB  - The high prevalence of sickle haemoglobin in Africa shows that malaria has been a
      major force for human evolutionary selection, but surprisingly few other
      polymorphisms have been proven to confer resistance to malaria in large
      epidemiological studies. To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum
      infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data
      in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus 
      close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for
      erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that
      provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence
      interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 x 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms
      that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, 
      on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees. Taken together 
      with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O, these
      data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or
      close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell
      membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has
      maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights
      into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome 
      of malaria infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The three members of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen
      (RESA) proteins family share high sequence homologies, which impair the detection
      and assignment to one or another protein of some pathogenic processes inherent to
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The present study was intended to determine if the
      antibody and inflammatory responses of children living in a malaria-endemic area 
      varied depending on the RESA-1, RESA-2 or RESA-3 proteins and the severity of the
      disease, two groups of severe and uncomplicated malaria cases being considered.
      METHODS: Two synthetic peptides representing predicted B cell epitopes were
      designed per RESA protein, all located outside of the 3' and 5' repetition
      blocks, in order to allow an antibody detection specific of each member of the
      family. Recombinant rRESA-1B and rRESA-3B proteins were also engineered. Two
      groups of Beninese children admitted to hospital in 2009 for either uncomplicated
      or severe malaria were compared for their plasma levels of IgG specifically
      recognizing each recombinant RESA protein or synthetic peptide, and for their
      plasma inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10), taking into
      account host and parasite genetic factors. RESULTS: The absence of IgG
      cross-reactivity between rRESA proteins and their protein carrier as well as
      between each RESA peptide and a non-epitopic RESA control peptide validated the
      use of the engineered recombinant proteins and peptides for the measurement of
      plasma IgG. Taking into account age, fever duration and parasitaemia, a multiple 
      logistic regression performed on children clustered according to their antibody
      responses' profiles concluded to an increased risk of severe malaria for P2
      (representative of RESA-1) responders (P = 0.007). Increased IL-10 plasma levels 
      were found in children harbouring multiclonal P. falciparum infections on the
      basis of the T1526G resa2 gene polymorphism (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      provided novel tools to dissect the seroreactivity against the three members of
      the RESA protein family and to describe its relation to protection against
      malaria. It suggested the measurement of plasma antibodies raised against
      specific peptides to serve as predictive immunologic markers for disease
      severity. Lastly, it reinforced previous observations linking the T1526G resa2
      gene mutation to severe malaria.

TI  - Genotype combinations of two IL4 polymorphisms influencing IL-4 plasma levels are
      associated with different risks of severe malaria in the Malian population.
PG  - 283-8
LID - 10.1007/s00251-015-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - We have previously found that children heterozygous for IL4 variable-number
      tandem repeat (VNTR) (rs8179190) or IL4-33 (rs2070874) variants were at risk for 
      severe malaria (SM), whereas homozygous children were protected suggesting a
      complex genetic control. Hence, to dissect this complex genetic control of IL4
      VNTR and IL4-33, we performed further investigation by conditional logistic
      regression analysis and found a strong interaction between both markers (p <
      10(-6)). The best-fit model revealed three genotype combinations associated with 
      different levels of SM risk. The highest risk (odds ratio (OR) = 4.8, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 2.0-11.5) was observed for subjects carrying at least 
      one copy of both IL4-33 allele T and IL4 VNTR allele 1, who exhibited higher
      interleukin (IL)-4 plasma levels (p = 0.007). Children homozygous for IL4 VNTR
      allele 2 had a lower SM risk as well as lower IL-4 plasma levels. Our findings
      indicate that the genetic interaction between these two IL-4 variants is a key
      factor of SM susceptibility, probably because of its direct role in IL-4
      regulation.

PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the relationship between complement receptor 1 (CR1)
      polymorphisms in exon 29 encoding the Knops blood group antigens (Swain-Langley
      (Sl) and McCoy (McC)) and outcome of clinical malaria have produced inconsistent 
      results. METHODS: Blood samples from Ghanaian children (n = 150) aged 1-12 years 
      with complicated and uncomplicated malaria were genotyped for the Sl and McC
      blood group alleles by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism. Effect of Sl and McC genotypes on the clinical outcome of malaria
      was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: McCa/b genotype was
      significantly associated with more than two-fold increased susceptibility for
      severe malaria (OR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.03-5.20, P = 0.043). However, McCb/b was
      associated with an 88% reduced risk of severe malaria (OR = 0.12; 95% CI:
      0.02-0.64, P = 0.013). In contrast, there was no significant association between 
      severe malaria and Sl1/1, Sl1/2, Sl2/and McCa/a genotypes. There was a trend
      towards decreased susceptibility to both cerebral malaria (CM) (OR = 0.13; 95%
      CI: 0.02-1.15, P = 0.07) and severe malarial anaemia (SA) (OR = 0.14; 95% CI:
      0.02-1.19, P = 0.07) for McCb/b genotype when compared with the McCa/a genotype. 
      There were no significant associations between Sl1/2 or Sl2/2 genotype and CM or 
      SA when compared with Sl1/1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: McCa/b was associated with
      increased susceptibility to severe malaria and McCb/b associated with reduced
      risk of severe malaria. Further studies with large sample size in other malaria
      endemic regions in Africa are warranted to confirm these findings.

      of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 153
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0668-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catabolizes haem and has both cytotoxic and
      cytoprotective effects. Polymorphisms in the promoter of the Haem oxygenase-1
      (HMOX1) gene encoding HO-1 have been associated with several diseases including
      severe malaria. The objective of this study was to determine the allele and
      genotype frequencies of two single nucleotide polymorphisms; A(-413)T and
      G(-1135)A, and a (GT)n repeat length polymorphism in the HMOX1 promoter in
      paediatric malaria patients and controls to determine possible associations with 
      malaria disease severity. METHODS: Study participants were Ghanaian children
      (n=296) admitted to the emergency room at the Department of Child Health,
      Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana during the malaria season from June to
      August in 1995, 1996 and 1997, classified as having uncomplicated malaria (n=101)
      or severe malaria (n=195; defined as severe anaemia (n=63) or cerebral malaria
      (n=132)). Furthermore, 287 individuals without a detectable Plasmodium infection 
      or asymptomatic carriers of the parasite were enrolled as controls. Blood samples
      from participants were extracted for DNA and allele and genotype frequencies were
      determined with allele-specific PCR, restriction fragment length analysis and
      microsatellite analysis. RESULTS: The number of (GT)n repeats in the study
      participants varied between 21 and 46 with the majority of alleles having lengths
      of 26 (8.1%), 29/30 (13.2/17.9%) and 39/40 (8.0/13.8%) repeats, and was
      categorized into short, medium and long repeats. The (-413)T allele was very
      common (69.8%), while the (-1135)A allele was present in only 17.4% of the
      Ghanaian population. The G(-1135)A locus was excluded from further analysis after
      failing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. No significant differences in allele
      or genotype distribution of the A(-413)T and (GT)n repeat polymorphisms were
      found between the controls and the malaria patients, or between the disease
      groups, for any of the analysed polymorphisms and no associations with malaria
      severity were found. CONCLUSION: These results contribute to the understanding of
      the role of HMOX1/HO-1. This current study did not find any evidence of
      association between HMOX1 promoter polymorphisms and malaria susceptibility or
      severe malaria and hence contradicts previous findings. Further studies are
      needed to fully elucidate the relationship between HMOX1 polymorphisms and
      malarial disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major worldwide public health problem with ~207
      million cases and ~627,000 deaths per year, mainly affecting children under five 
      years of age in Africa. Recent efforts at elaborating a genetic architecture of
      malaria have focused on severe malaria, leading to the identification of two new 
      genes and confirmation of previously known variants in HBB, ABO and G6PD, by
      exploring the whole human genome in genome-wide association (GWA) studies.
      Molecular pathways controlling phenotypes representing effectiveness of host
      immunity, notably parasitemia and IgG levels, are of particular interest given
      the current lack of an efficacious vaccine and the need for new treatment
      options. RESULTS: We propose a global causal framework of malaria phenotypes
      implicating progression from the initial infection with Plasmodium spp. to the
      development of the infection through liver and blood-stage multiplication cycles 
      (parasitemia as a quantitative trait), to clinical malaria attack, and finally to
      severe malaria. Genetic polymorphism may control any of these stages, such that
      preceding stages act as mediators of subsequent stages. A biomarker of humoral
      immunity, IgG levels, can also be integrated into the framework, potentially
      mediating the impact of polymorphism by limiting parasitemia levels. Current
      knowledge of the genetic basis of parasitemia levels and IgG levels is reviewed
      through key examples including the hemoglobinopathies, showing that the
      protective effect of HBB variants on malaria clinical phenotypes may partially be
      mediated through parasitemia and cytophilic IgG levels. Another example is the
      IgG receptor FcgammaRIIa, encoded by FCGR2A, such that H131 homozygotes displayed
      higher IgG2 levels and were protective against high parasitemia and onset of
      malaria symptoms as shown in a causal diagram. CONCLUSIONS: We thus underline the
      value of parasitemia and IgG levels as phenotypes in the understanding of the
      human genetic architecture of malaria, and the need for applying GWA approaches
      to these phenotypes.

AB  - Populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection develop genetic mechanisms
      of protection against severe malarial disease. Despite decades of genetic
      epidemiological research, the sickle cell trait (HbAS) sickle cell polymorphism, 
      ABO blood group, and other hemoglobinopathies remain the few major determinants
      in severe malaria to be replicated across different African populations and study
      designs. Within a case-control study in a region of high transmission in Tanzania
      (n = 983), we investigated the role of 40 new loci identified in recent
      genome-wide studies. In 32 loci passing quality control procedures, we found
      polymorphisms in USP38, FREM3, SDC1, DDC, and LOC727982 genes to be putatively
      associated with differential susceptibility to severe malaria. Established
      candidates explained 7.4% of variation in severe malaria risk (HbAS polymorphism,
      6.3%; alpha-thalassemia, 0.3%; ABO group, 0.3%; and glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase deficiency, 0.5%) and the new polymorphisms, another 4.3%. The
      regions encompassing the loci identified are promising targets for the design of 
      future treatment and control interventions.

AB  - TPI1 promoter polymorphisms occur in high prevalence in individuals from African 
      origin. Malaria-patients from Angola and Mozambique were screened for the TPI1
      gene promoter variants rs1800200A>G, (-5G>A), rs1800201G>A, (-8G>A),
      rs1800202T>G, (-24T>G), and for the intron 5 polymorphism rs2071069G>A,
      (2262G>A). -5G>A and -8G>A variants occur in 47% and 53% in Angola and
      Mozambique, respectively while -24T>G was monomorphic for the wild-type T allele.
      Six haplotypes were identified and -8A occurred in 45% of the individuals,
      especially associated with the GAG haplotype and more frequent in non-severe
      malaria groups, although not significantly. The arising and dispersion of -5G>A
      and -8G>A polymorphisms is controversial. Their age was estimated by analyses of 
      two microsatellite loci, CD4 and ATN1, adjacent to TPI1 gene. The -5G>A is older 
      than -8G>A, with an average estimate of approximately 35,000 years. The -8A
      variant arose in two different backgrounds, suggesting independent mutational
      events. The first, on the -5G background, may have occurred in East Africa around
      20,800 years ago; the second, on the -5A background, may have occurred in West
      Africa some 7500 years ago. These estimates are within the period of spread of
      agriculture and the malaria mosquito vector in Africa, which could has been a
      possible reason for the selection of -8A polymorphism in malaria endemic
      countries.

AB  - We assessed Plasmodium (P.) falciparum allelic diversity based on clinical
      severity and age. The study was conducted from 2011 to 2012 in Libreville, Gabon 
      where malaria prevalence was 24.5%. The polymorphism of the merozoite surface
      protein-1 (msp1) locus was analyzed in isolates from patients with complicated
      and uncomplicated malaria. Blood was collected on filter paper. After DNA
      extraction, genotyping of the msp1 gene was performed using nested PCR. The K1,
      Ro33, and Mad20 allelic families were detected in 71 (63%), 64 (57%), and 38
      (34%) of the 112 analyzed samples, respectively. Overall, 17 K1 and 11 Mad20
      alleles were detected. There was no association between msp1 allelic families and
      age. Mad20 allelic diversity increased with the severity of malaria. The number
      of K1 and Mad20 alleles decreased with age. The multiplicity of infection (MOI)
      was 1-6 genotypes and the complexity of infection (COI) 1.8 +/- 1. The COI
      differed based on age: it was 1.9 (+/-1.1) in the isolates from adults, 1.8
      (+/-1.1) in those from 0-5 year-old children, whereas it tended to be lower (1.6 
      +/- 0.8) in those from 6-15 year-old children. Extensive genetic diversity is
      found in P. falciparum strains circulating in Libreville. The number of specific 
      msp1 alleles increased with clinical severity, suggesting an association between 
      the diversity and the severity of malaria.

TI  - Endothelial protein C receptor gene variants not associated with severe malaria
      in ghanaian children.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115770 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two recent reports have identified the Endothelial Protein C Receptor
      (EPCR) as a key molecule implicated in severe malaria pathology. First, it was
      shown that EPCR in the human microvasculature mediates sequestration of
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Second, microvascular thrombosis,
      one of the major processes causing cerebral malaria, was linked to a reduction in
      EPCR expression in cerebral endothelial layers. It was speculated that genetic
      variation affecting EPCR functionality could influence susceptibility to severe
      malaria phenotypes, rendering PROCR, the gene encoding EPCR, a promising
      candidate for an association study. METHODS: Here, we performed an association
      study including high-resolution variant discovery of rare and frequent genetic
      variants in the PROCR gene. The study group, which previously has proven to be a 
      valuable tool for studying the genetics of malaria, comprised 1,905 severe
      malaria cases aged 1-156 months and 1,866 apparently healthy children aged 2-161 
      months from the Ashanti Region in Ghana, West Africa, where malaria is highly
      endemic. Association of genetic variation with severe malaria phenotypes was
      examined on the basis of single variants, reconstructed haplotypes, and rare
      variant analyses. RESULTS: A total of 41 genetic variants were detected in
      regulatory and coding regions of PROCR, 17 of which were previously unknown
      genetic variants. In association tests, none of the single variants, haplotypes
      or rare variants showed evidence for an association with severe malaria, cerebral
      malaria, or severe malaria anemia. CONCLUSION: Here we present the first analysis
      of genetic variation in the PROCR gene in the context of severe malaria in
      African subjects and show that genetic variation in the PROCR gene in our study
      population does not influence susceptibility to major severe malaria phenotypes.

      children.
PG  - 67-71
LID - 10.1007/s00251-014-0816-z [doi]
AB  - The clinical course of malaria varies between affected individuals and host
      genetic factors have been shown to influence the outcome of malaria. The role of 
      FOXO3-driven pathway in modulating inflammatory responses, including mediation of
      distinct functions of regulatory T effector cell populations (Tregs) by the
      transcription factor FOXO3, has recently been recognized. We aimed to study
      possible associations of a non-coding polymorphism in intron 2 of the FOXO3A gene
      (rs12212067T>G) that was shown earlier to modulate the FOXO3 expression and to be
      associated with the prognosis of distinct inflammatory and infectious diseases.
      The FOXO3A polymorphism rs12212067T>G was genotyped by direct sequencing in a
      group of Gabonese children with confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Severe
      cases of malaria were compared with asymptomatic/mild cases. The FOXO3A variant
      rs12212067T>G was associated with the phenotype of severe malaria, but not with
      asymptomatic/mild malaria (allelic model: OR = 1.54, 95 % CI = 1.15-2.05, P =
      0.0028; dominant model: OR = 1.94, 95 % CI = 1.36-2.77, P = 0.0002). The FOXO3A
      variant rs12212067T>G is associated with increased inflammatory responses to
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria, indicating a role of the FOXO3-dependent pathway
      in malaria.

      gene expression patterns among Kenyan children.
PG  - 524
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-14-524 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Host genotype accounts for a component of the variability in
      susceptibility to childhood Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, despite
      numerous examples of host polymorphisms associated with tolerance or resistance
      to infection, direct evidence for an impact of host genetic polymorphisms on the 
      in vivo parasite population is difficult to obtain. Parasite molecules whose
      expression is most likely to be associated with such adaptation are those that
      are directly involved in the host-parasite interaction. A prime candidate is the 
      family of parasite var gene-encoded molecules on P. falciparum-infected
      erythrocytes, PfEMP1, which binds various host molecules and facilitates parasite
      sequestration in host tissues to avoid clearance by the spleen. METHODS: To
      assess the impact of host genotype on the infecting parasite population we used a
      published parasite var gene sequence dataset to compare var gene expression
      patterns between parasites from children with polymorphisms in molecules thought 
      to interact with or modulate display of PfEMP1 on the infected erythrocyte
      surface: ABO blood group, haemoglobin S, alpha-thalassaemia, the T188G
      polymorphism of CD36 and the K29M polymorphism of ICAM1. RESULTS: Expression
      levels of 'group A-like' var genes, which encode a specific group of PfEMP1
      variants previously associated with low host immunity and severe malaria, showed 
      signs of elevation among children of blood group AB. No other host factor tested 
      showed evidence for an association with var expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      preliminary findings suggest that host ABO blood group may have a measurable
      impact on the infecting parasite population. This needs to be verified in larger 
      studies.

TI  - Reappraisal of known malaria resistance loci in a large multicenter study.
PG  - 1197-204
LID - 10.1038/ng.3107 [doi]
AB  - Many human genetic associations with resistance to malaria have been reported,
      but few have been reliably replicated. We collected data on 11,890 cases of
      severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum and 17,441 controls from 12 locations
      in Africa, Asia and Oceania. We tested 55 SNPs in 27 loci previously reported to 
      associate with severe malaria. There was evidence of association at P < 1 x
      10(-4) with the HBB, ABO, ATP2B4, G6PD and CD40LG loci, but previously reported
      associations at 22 other loci did not replicate in the multicenter analysis. The 
      large sample size made it possible to identify authentic genetic effects that are
      heterogeneous across populations or phenotypes, with a striking example being the
      main African form of G6PD deficiency, which reduced the risk of cerebral malaria 
      but increased the risk of severe malarial anemia. The finding that G6PD
      deficiency has opposing effects on different fatal complications of P. falciparum
      infection indicates that the evolutionary origins of this common human genetic
      disorder are more complex than previously supposed.

PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s12881-014-0093-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
      deficiency and clinical phenomena such as primaquine-sensitivity and protection
      from severe malaria remains poorly defined, with past association studies
      yielding inconsistent and conflicting results. One possibility is that
      examination of a single genetic variant might underestimate the presence of true 
      effects in the presence of unrecognized functional allelic diversity. METHODS: We
      systematically examined this possibility in Kenya, conducting a fine-mapping
      association study of erythrocyte G6PD activity in 1828 Kenyan children across 30 
      polymorphisms at or around the G6PD locus. RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong
      functional role for c.202G>A (rs1050828), which accounts for the majority of
      variance in enzyme activity observed (P=1.5x10(-)(2)(0)(0), additive model).
      Additionally, we identify other common variants that exert smaller,
      intercorrelated effects independent of c.202G>A, and haplotype analyses suggest
      that each variant tags one of two haplotype motifs that are opposite in sequence 
      identity and effect direction. We posit that these effects are of biological and 
      possible clinical significance, specifically noting that c.376A>G (rs1050829)
      augments 202AG heterozygote risk for deficiency trait by two-fold (OR = 2.11
      [1.12 - 3.84], P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that c.202G>A is
      responsible for the majority of the observed prevalence of G6PD deficiency trait 
      in Kenya, but also identify a novel role for c.376A>G as a genetic modifier which
      marks a common haplotype that augments the risk conferred to 202AG heterozygotes,
      suggesting that variation at both loci merits consideration in genetic
      association studies probing G6PD deficiency-associated clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphisms and susceptibility to mild
      malaria in Dogon and Fulani, Mali.
PG  - 270
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is associated
      with protection from severe malaria, and potentially uncomplicated malaria
      phenotypes. It has been documented that G6PD deficiency in sub-Saharan Africa is 
      due to the 202A/376G G6PD A-allele, and association studies have used genotyping 
      as a convenient technique for epidemiological studies. However, recent studies
      have shown discrepancies in G6PD202/376 associations with severe malaria. There
      is evidence to suggest that other G6PD deficiency alleles may be common in some
      regions of West Africa, and that allelic heterogeneity could explain these
      discrepancies. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study of malaria
      susceptibility was conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Sahel meso-endemic
      malaria zone of Mali. The study included Dogon (n = 375) and Fulani (n = 337)
      sympatric ethnic groups, where the latter group is characterized by lower
      susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Fifty-three G6PD polymorphisms, 
      including 202/376, were genotyped across the 712 samples. Evidence of association
      of these G6PD polymorphisms and mild malaria was assessed in both ethnic groups
      using genotypic and haplotypic statistical tests. RESULTS: It was confirmed that 
      the Fulani are less susceptible to malaria, and the 202A mutation is rare in this
      group (<1% versus Dogon 7.9%). The Betica-Selma 968C/376G (~11% enzymatic
      activity) was more common in Fulani (6.1% vs Dogon 0.0%). There are differences
      in haplotype frequencies between Dogon and Fulani, and association analysis did
      not reveal strong evidence of protective G6PD genetic effects against
      uncomplicated malaria in both ethnic groups and gender. However, there was some
      evidence of increased risk of mild malaria in Dogon with the 202A mutation,
      attaining borderline statistical significance in females. The rs915942
      polymorphism was found to be associated with asymptomatic malaria in Dogon
      females, and the rs61042368 polymorphism was associated with clinical malaria in 
      Fulani males. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need to consider markers in 
      addition to G6PD202 in studies of deficiency. Further, large genetic
      epidemiological studies of multi-ethnic groups in West Africa across a spectrum
      of malaria severity phenotypes are required to establish who receives protection 
      from G6PD deficiency.

TI  - Association of candidate gene polymorphisms and TGF-beta/IL-10 levels with
      malaria in three regions of Cameroon: a case-control study.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the most widespread and
      deadliest infectious diseases in children under five years in endemic areas. The 
      disease has been a strong force for evolutionary selection in the human genome,
      and uncovering the critical host genetic factors that confer resistance to the
      disease would provide clues to the molecular basis of protective immunity and
      improve vaccine development initiatives. METHODS: The effect of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and
      interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels on malaria pathology was investigated in a
      case-control study of 1862 individuals from two major ethnic groups in three
      regions with intense perennial P. falciparum transmission in Cameroon.
      Thirty-four malaria candidate polymorphisms, including the sickle cell trait
      (HbS), were assayed on the Sequenom iPLEX platform while plasma TGF-beta and
      IL-10 levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: The study confirms the
      known protective effect of HbS against severe malaria and also reveals a
      protective effect of SNPs in the nitrogen oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) gene against
      malaria infection, anaemia and uncomplicated malaria. Furthermore, ADCY9
      rs10775349 (additive G) and ABO rs8176746 AC individuals were associated with
      protection from hyperpyrexia and hyperparasitaemia, respectively. Meanwhile,
      individuals with the EMR1 rs373533 GT, EMR1 rs461645 CT and RTN3 rs542998
      (additive C) genotypes were more susceptible to hyperpyrexia while both females
      and males with the rs1050828 and rs1050829 SNPs of G6PD, respectively, were more 
      vulnerable to anaemia. Plasma TGF-beta levels were strongly correlated with
      heterozygosity for the ADCY9 rs2230739 and HBB rs334 SNPs while individuals with 
      the ABO rs8176746 AC genotype had lower IL-10 levels. CONCLUSION: Taken together,
      this study suggests that some rare polymorphisms in candidate genes may have
      important implications for the susceptibility of Cameroonians to severe malaria. 
      Moreover using the uncomplicated malaria phenotype may permit the identification 
      of novel pathways in the early development of the disease.

TI  - Polymorphisms in Pfmdr1, Pfcrt, and Pfnhe1 genes are associated with reduced in
      vitro activities of quinine in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from western Kenya.
PG  - 3737-43
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02472-14 [doi]
AB  - In combination with antibiotics, quinine is recommended as the second-line
      treatment for uncomplicated malaria, an alternative first-line treatment for
      severe malaria, and for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy.
      Quinine has been shown to have frequent clinical failures, and yet the mechanisms
      of action and resistance have not been fully elucidated. However, resistance is
      linked to polymorphisms in multiple genes, including multidrug resistance 1
      (Pfmdr1), the chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), and the sodium/hydrogen
      exchanger gene (Pfnhe1). Here, we investigated the association between in vitro
      quinine susceptibility and genetic polymorphisms in Pfmdr1codons 86 and 184,
      Pfcrt codon 76, and Pfnhe1 ms4760 in 88 field isolates from western Kenya. In
      vitro activity was assessed based on the drug concentration that inhibited 50% of
      parasite growth (the IC50), and parasite genetic polymorphisms were determined
      from DNA sequencing. Data revealed there were significant associations between
      polymorphism in Pfmdr1-86Y, Pfmdr1-184F, or Pfcrt-76T and quinine susceptibility 
      (P < 0.0001 for all three associations). Eighty-two percent of parasites
      resistant to quinine carried mutant alleles at these codons (Pfmdr1-86Y,
      Pfmdr1-184F, and Pfcrt-76T), whereas 74% of parasites susceptible to quinine
      carried the wild-type allele (Pfmdr1-N86, Pfmdr1-Y184, and Pfcrt-K76,
      respectively). In addition, quinine IC50 values for parasites with Pfnhe1 ms4760 
      3 DNNND repeats were significantly higher than for those with 1 or 2 repeats (P =
      0.033 and P = 0.0043, respectively). Clinical efficacy studies are now required
      to confirm the validity of these markers and the importance of parasite genetic
      background.

TI  - Imputation without doing imputation: a new method for the detection of
      non-genotyped causal variants.
PG  - 173-90
LID - 10.1002/gepi.21792 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies allow detection of non-genotyped disease-causing 
      variants through testing of nearby genotyped SNPs. This approach may fail when
      there are no genotyped SNPs in strong LD with the causal variant. Several
      genotyped SNPs in weak LD with the causal variant may, however, considered
      together, provide equivalent information. This observation motivates popular but 
      computationally intensive approaches based on imputation or haplotyping. Here we 
      present a new method and accompanying software designed for this scenario. Our
      approach proceeds by selecting, for each genotyped "anchor" SNP, a nearby
      genotyped "partner" SNP, chosen via a specific algorithm we have developed. These
      two SNPs are used as predictors in linear or logistic regression analysis to
      generate a final significance test. In simulations, our method captures much of
      the signal captured by imputation, while taking a fraction of the time and disc
      space, and generating a smaller number of false-positives. We apply our method to
      a case/control study of severe malaria genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K array.
      Previous analysis showed that fine-scale sequencing of a Gambian reference panel 
      in the region of the known causal locus, followed by imputation, increased the
      signal of association to genome-wide significance levels. Our method also
      increases the signal of association from P approximately 2 x 10(-)(6) to P
      approximately 6 x 10(-)(1)(1). Our method thus, in some cases, eliminates the
      need for more complex methods such as sequencing and imputation, and provides a
      useful additional test that may be used to identify genetic regions of interest.

TI  - Association of cytokine and Toll-like receptor gene polymorphisms with severe
      malaria in three regions of Cameroon.
PG  - e81071
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0081071 [doi]
AB  - P. falciparum malaria is one of the most widespread and deadliest infectious
      diseases in children under five years in endemic areas. The disease has been a
      strong force for evolutionary selection in the human genome, and uncovering the
      critical human genetic factors that confer resistance to the disease would
      provide clues to the molecular basis of protective immunity that would be
      invaluable for vaccine development. We investigated the effect of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on malaria pathology in a case- control study of 
      1862 individuals from two major ethnic groups in three regions with intense
      perennial P. falciparum transmission in Cameroon. Twenty nine polymorphisms in
      cytokine and toll-like receptor (TLR) genes as well as the sickle cell trait
      (HbS) were assayed on the Sequenom iPLEX platform. Our results confirm the known 
      protective effect of HbS against severe malaria and also reveal a protective
      effect of SNPs in interleukin-10 (IL10) cerebral malaria and hyperpyrexia.
      Furthermore, IL17RE rs708567 GA and hHbS rs334 AT individuals were associated
      with protection from uncomplicated malaria and anaemia respectively in this
      study. Meanwhile, individuals with the hHbS rs334 TT, IL10 rs3024500 AA, and
      IL17RD rs6780995 GA genotypes were more susceptible to severe malarial anaemia,
      cerebral malaria, and hyperpyrexia respectively. Taken together, our results
      suggest that polymorphisms in some immune response genes may have important
      implications for the susceptibility to severe malaria in Cameroonians. Moreover
      using uncomplicated malaria may allow us to identify novel pathways in the early 
      development of the disease.

TI  - In vitro susceptibility to quinine and microsatellite variations of the
      Plasmodium falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger transporter (Pfnhe-1) gene in 393 isolates
      from Dakar, Senegal.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-12-189 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the World Health Organization recommends replacing quinine
      (QN) by artesunate due to its increased efficacy and the higher tolerance to the 
      drug in both adults and children, QN remains a first-line treatment for severe
      malaria, especially in Africa. Investigations of microsatellite Pfnhe-1 ms4760
      polymorphisms in culture-adapted isolates from around the world have revealed
      that an increase in the number of DNNND amino acid motifs was associated with
      decreased QN susceptibility, whereas an increase in the number of DDNHNDNHNND
      motifs was associated with increased QN susceptibility. METHODS: In this context,
      to further analyse associations between Pfnhe-1 ms4760 polymorphisms and QN
      susceptibility, 393 isolates freshly collected between October 2009 and January
      2010 and July 2010 and February 2011, respectively, at the Hopital Principal de
      Dakar, Senegal were assessed ex vivo for QN susceptibility, and their genes were 
      amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Of the 393 Plasmodium falciparum clinical
      isolates collected, 145 were successfully cultured. The 145 QN IC50s ranged from 
      2.1 to 1291 nM, and 17 isolates (11.7%) exceed the QN reduced susceptibility
      threshold of 611 nM. Among the 393 P. falciparum clinical isolates, 47 different 
      alleles were observed. The three most prevalent profiles were ms4760-1 (no = 72; 
      18.3%), ms4760-3 (no = 65; 16.5%) and ms4760-7 (no = 40; 10.2%). There were no
      significant associations observed between QN IC50 values and i) the number of
      repeats of DNNND in block II (p = 0.0955, Kruskal-Wallis test); ii) the number of
      repeats of DDNHNDNHNND in block V (p = 0.1455, Kruskal-Wallis test); or iii)
      ms4760 profiles (p = 0.1809, Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: Pfnhe-1 ms4760
      was highly diverse in parasite isolates from Dakar (47 different profiles). Three
      profiles (ms4760-1, ms4760-3 and ms4760-7) were predominant. The number of
      repeats for block II (DNNND) or block V (DDNHNDNHNND) was not significantly
      associated with QN susceptibility. New studies, and especially in vivo studies,
      are necessary to confirm the role of Pfnhe-1 ms4760 as a marker of QN resistance.

AB  - Combining data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted at different
      locations, using genotype imputation and fixed-effects meta-analysis, has been a 
      powerful approach for dissecting complex disease genetics in populations of
      European ancestry. Here we investigate the feasibility of applying the same
      approach in Africa, where genetic diversity, both within and between populations,
      is far more extensive. We analyse genome-wide data from approximately 5,000
      individuals with severe malaria and 7,000 population controls from three
      different locations in Africa. Our results show that the standard approach is
      well powered to detect known malaria susceptibility loci when sample sizes are
      large, and that modern methods for association analysis can control the potential
      confounding effects of population structure. We show that pattern of association 
      around the haemoglobin S allele differs substantially across populations due to
      differences in haplotype structure. Motivated by these observations we consider
      new approaches to association analysis that might prove valuable for multicentre 
      GWAS in Africa: we relax the assumptions of SNP-based fixed effect analysis; we
      apply Bayesian approaches to allow for heterogeneity in the effect of an allele
      on risk across studies; and we introduce a region-based test to allow for
      heterogeneity in the location of causal alleles.

TI  - Relationship between alpha+-thalassaemia and glutathione-S-transferases
      polymorphisms in children with severe malaria in Tanzania.
PG  - 82-7
AB  - Alpha+-thalassaemia is well known for conferring partial protection to severe
      malaria. On the other, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) polymorphism has recently 
      been associated to severe malaria in children. A retrospective cross sectional
      study was carried out to determine the relationship between genotypic
      polymorphisms of alpha+-thalassaemia and glutathione-S-transferase in children
      with severe malaria. A total of 148 DNA samples from children aged between 3 and 
      15 years with mild and severe malaria were retrieved and determined by polymerase
      chain reaction. Children with Glutathione-S-transferase-pil (GSTP1)-polymorphism 
      were observed to have three fold risk (OR = 2.9; 95% CI =1.3- 6.1; P = 0.006) of 
      developing severe malaria compared to mild malaria in Mnyuzi in Korogwe District,
      north-eastern, Tanzania. In the presence of Glutathione-S-transferase-pil
      polymorphism, children were found to have 3% decreased protective effect of
      alpha+-thalassaemia polymorphisms (homozygotes and heterozygotes) against severe 
      malaria although this was not statistically significant [OR = 0.81 (95% CI =
      0.5-1.5; P = 0.5) to OR =0.78(95% CI = 0.4-1.5; P = 0.44)]. We conclude that
      Glutathione-S-transferase-pil polymorphism increases risk of developing severe
      malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in children. The observed inverse
      relationship between GSTP1 polymorphisms and alpha-thalassaemia to children with 
      severe malaria need further investigation.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum infections in mild and severe malaria 
      of children from Kampala, Uganda.

AB  - Diversity in parasite virulence is one of the factors that contribute to the
      clinical outcome of malaria infections. The association between the severity of
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria and the number of distinct parasite populations
      infecting the host (multiplicity of infection) or polymorphism within any of the 
      specific antigen genes was investigated. The study included 164 children
      presenting with mild and severe malaria from central Uganda where malaria is
      meso-endemic. The polymorphic regions of the circumsporozoite protein (csp),
      merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (msp1 and msp2), and glutamate-rich protein
      (glurp) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction methods and fragment analysis
      by gel electrophoresis. In a subset of samples fragment analysis was also
      performed by fluorescent PCR genotyping followed by capillary electrophoresis.
      The multiplicity of infection (MOI), determined as the highest number of alleles 
      detected within any of the four genetic loci, was significantly higher in severe 
      than in mild malaria cases (mean 3.7 and 3.0, respectively, P=0.002). No
      particular genotype or allelic family of msp1 or msp2 was associated with
      severity of malaria, and nor did the genotyping method reveal any significant
      difference in MOI when only assessed by msp2 genotyping. Severity of malaria was 
      not linked to the predominance of any particular msp1 or msp2 allelic types,
      independent of methods used for genotyping. Monitoring the dynamics of multiple
      clone infections in relation to disease outcome, host immune status and genetic
      factors will provide more insight into parasite virulence mechanisms.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in mapping the genes of pathogens which underlie 
      important phenotypic traits such as virulence and drug resistance. The Plasmodium
      falciparum genome exhibits sequence variation that contributes to the pathogenic 
      mechanisms of the parasite. Determining the prevalence of resistance markers
      could provide a prediction about drug efficacy. Copy number polymorphism (CNP) of
      genes has been shown to influence important parasite phenotypes. In this work,
      CNPs within genes involved in drug resistance and other phenotypic traits namely 
      P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr-1), GTP cyclo hydrolase (gch1), Ring 
      infected erythrocyte surface antigen precursor (resa) and a hypothetical protein 
      coding gene were analyzed by quantitative real time-polymerase reaction (qRT-PCR)
      among clinical isolates collected from Uganda. The pfmdr-1 codons 86 and 1246 and
      P. falciparum chloroquine resistance (pfcrt) codon 76 were genotyped for single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and the proportion of resistance associated
      mutations were determined among mild and severe malaria cases using the
      chi-square test. Forty and 42 P. falciparum isolates collected from children with
      mild and severe malaria respectively were analyzed for CNPs. Seventy five and 81 
      P. falciparum isolates from children with mild or severe malaria were analyzed
      for SNPs. No pfmdr-1, gch1 or novel gene amplifications were identified among the
      P. falciparum clinical isolates. Although chloroquine was officially withdrawn
      from policy use since 7 years, all P. falciparum isolates presented the
      associated pfcrt K76T mutation, whatever the clinical status and no specific
      mutation in the pfmdr-1 gene was associated with disease type. In conclusion,
      this study provides baseline measures for continued surveillance for changes in
      copy number and SNP types among genes implicated in drug resistance and other
      important phenotypes that may have a potential role in parasite virulence
      mechanisms or drug treatment outcomes.

AB  - Human genetic background strongly influences susceptibility to malaria infection 
      and progression to severe disease and death. Classical genetic studies identified
      haemoglobinopathies and erythrocyte-associated polymorphisms, as protective
      against severe disease. High throughput genotyping by mass spectrometry allows
      multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be examined simultaneously. We
      compared the prevalence of 65 human SNP's, previously associated with altered
      risk of malaria, between Tanzanian children with and without severe malaria. Five
      hundred children, aged 1-10 years, with severe malaria were recruited from those 
      admitted to hospital in Muheza, Tanzania and compared with matched controls.
      Genotyping was performed by Sequenom MassArray, and conventional PCR was used to 
      detect deletions in the alpha-thalassaemia gene. SNPs in two X-linked genes were 
      associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females but not in males:
      heterozygosity for one or other of two SNPs in the G6PD gene was associated with 
      protection from all forms of severe disease whilst two SNPs in the gene encoding 
      CD40L were associated with respiratory distress. A SNP in the adenyl cyclase 9
      (ADCY9) gene was associated with protection from acidosis whilst a polymorphism
      in the IL-1alpha gene (IL1A) was associated with an increased risk of acidosis.
      SNPs in the genes encoding IL-13 and reticulon-3 (RTN3) were associated with
      increased risk of cerebral malaria. This study confirms previously known genetic 
      associations with protection from severe malaria (HbS, G6PD). It identifies two
      X-linked genes associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females,
      identifies mutations in ADCY9, IL1A and CD40L as being associated with altered
      risk of severe respiratory distress and acidosis, both of which are characterised
      by high serum lactate levels, and also identifies novel genetic associations with
      severe malaria (TRIM5) and cerebral malaria(IL-13 and RTN3). Further studies are 
      required to test the generality of these associations and to understand their
      functional consequences.

AB  - Malaria is a major health burden in sub-Saharan African countries, including
      Mali. The disease is complex, with multiple genetic determinants influencing the 
      observed variation in response to infection, progression, and severity. We assess
      the influence of sixty-four candidate loci, including the sickle cell
      polymorphism (HbS), on severe malaria in a case-control study consisting of over 
      900 individuals from Bamako, Mali. We confirm the known protective effects of the
      blood group O and the HbS AS genotype on life-threatening malaria. In addition,
      our analysis revealed a marginal susceptibility effect for the CD40 ligand
      (CD40L)+220C allele. The lack of statistical evidence for other candidates may
      demonstrate the need for large-scale genome-wide association studies in malaria
      to discover new polymorphisms. It also demonstrates the need for establishing the
      region-specific repertoire of functional variation in important genes, including 
      the glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency gene, before embarking on focused
      genotyping.

TI  - Sequence variation does not confound the measurement of plasma PfHRP2
      concentration in African children presenting with severe malaria.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein PFHRP2 measurement is
      used widely for diagnosis, and more recently for severity assessment in
      falciparum malaria. The Pfhrp2 gene is highly polymorphic, with deletion of the
      entire gene reported in both laboratory and field isolates. These issues
      potentially confound the interpretation of PFHRP2 measurements. METHODS: Studies 
      designed to detect deletion of Pfhrp2 and its paralog Pfhrp3 were undertaken with
      samples from patients in seven countries contributing to the largest
      hospital-based severe malaria trial (AQUAMAT). The quantitative relationship
      between sequence polymorphism and PFHRP2 plasma concentration was examined in
      samples from selected sites in Mozambique and Tanzania. RESULTS: There was no
      evidence for deletion of either Pfhrp2 or Pfhrp3 in the 77 samples with lowest
      PFHRP2 plasma concentrations across the seven countries. Pfhrp2 sequence
      diversity was very high with no haplotypes shared among 66 samples sequenced.
      There was no correlation between Pfhrp2 sequence length or repeat type and PFHRP2
      plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that sequence
      polymorphism is not a significant cause of variation in PFHRP2 concentration in
      plasma samples from African children. This justifies the further development of
      plasma PFHRP2 concentration as a method for assessing African children who may
      have severe falciparum malaria. The data also add to the existing evidence base
      supporting the use of rapid diagnostic tests based on PFHRP2 detection.

TI  - Genome-wide association study indicates two novel resistance loci for severe
      malaria.
PG  - 443-6
LID - 10.1038/nature11334 [doi]
AB  - Malaria causes approximately one million fatalities per year, mostly among
      African children. Although highlighted by the strong protective effect of the
      sickle-cell trait, the full impact of human genetics on resistance to the disease
      remains largely unexplored. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are designed to
      unravel relevant genetic variants comprehensively; however, in malaria, as in
      other infectious diseases, these studies have been only partly successful. Here
      we identify two previously unknown loci associated with severe falciparum malaria
      in patients and controls from Ghana, West Africa. We applied the GWA approach to 
      the diverse clinical syndromes of severe falciparum malaria, thereby targeting
      human genetic variants influencing any step in the complex pathogenesis of the
      disease. One of the loci was identified on chromosome 1q32 within the ATP2B4
      gene, which encodes the main calcium pump of erythrocytes, the host cells of the 
      pathogenic stage of malaria parasites. The second was indicated by an intergenic 
      single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 16q22.2, possibly linked to a
      neighbouring gene encoding the tight-junction protein MARVELD3. The protein is
      expressed on endothelial cells and might therefore have a role in microvascular
      damage caused by endothelial adherence of parasitized erythrocytes. We also
      confirmed previous reports on protective effects of the sickle-cell trait and
      blood group O. Our findings underline the potential of the GWA approach to
      provide candidates for the development of control measures against infectious
      diseases in humans.

TI  - Role of polymorphisms of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR9, toll-interleukin 1
      receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and FCGR2A genes in malaria
      susceptibility and severity in Burundian children.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is one of the leading causes 
      of human morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, predominantly in
      tropical and sub-tropical countries. As genetic variations in the toll-like
      receptors (TLRs)-signalling pathway have been associated with either
      susceptibility or resistance to several infectious and inflammatory diseases, the
      supposition is that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR2, TLR4, TLR9,
      Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and FCGR2A 
      could modulate malaria susceptibility and severity. METHODS: This study was
      planned to make a further contribution to solving the problem of the real role of
      the most common polymorphisms of TLR4, TLR9, TIRAP and FCGR2A genes in modulating
      the risk of malaria and disease severity in children from Burundi, Central
      Africa. All the paediatric patients aged six months to 10 years admitted to the
      hospital of Kiremba, Burundi, between February 2011 and September 2011, for fever
      and suspicion of acute malaria were screened for malaria parasitaemia by light
      microscopy of thick and thin blood smears. In children with malaria and in
      uninfected controls enrolled during the study period in the same hospital, blood 
      samples were obtained on filter paper and TLR4 Asp299Gly rs4986790, TLR9 G1174A
      rs352139, T-1486 C rs187084 TLR9 T-1237 C rs5743836, TIRAP Ser180Leu rs8177374
      and the FCGR2A His131Arg rs1801274 polymorphisms were studied using an ABI PRISM 
      7900 HT Fast Real-time instrument. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients and 337
      controls were enrolled. Among the malaria cases, 553 (91.9%) were considered as
      suffering from uncomplicated and 49 (8.1%) from severe malaria. TLR9 T1237C
      rs5743836CC was associated with an increased risk of developing malaria (p=0.03),
      although it was found with the same frequency in uncomplicated and severe malaria
      cases. No other differences were found in all alleles studied and in genotype
      frequencies between malaria cases and uninfected controls as well as between
      uncomplicated and severe malaria cases. CONCLUSIONS: TLR9 T1237C seems to
      condition susceptibility to malaria in Burundian children but not its severity,
      whereas none of the assessed SNPs of TLR4, TIRAP and FCGR2A seem to influence
      susceptibility to malaria and disease severity in this population.

      severe malaria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exports proteins that remodel the erythrocyte
      membrane. One such protein, called Pf155/RESA (RESA1) contributes to parasite
      fitness, optimizing parasite survival during febrile episodes. Resa1 gene is a
      member of a small family comprising three highly related genes. Preliminary
      evidence led to a search for clues indicating the involvement of RESA2 protein in
      the pathophysiology of malaria. In the present study, cDNA sequence of resa2 gene
      was obtained from two different strains. The proportion of P. falciparum isolates
      having a non-stop T1526C mutation in resa2 gene was evaluated and the association
      of this genotype with severity of malaria was investigated. METHODS: Resa2 cDNAs 
      of two different strains (a patient isolate and K1 culture adapted strain) was
      obtained by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing was performed to confirm its gene
      structure. The proportion of isolates having a T1526C mutation was evaluated
      using a PCR-RFLP methodology on groups of severe malaria and uncomplicated
      patients recruited in 1991-1994 in Senegal and in 2009 in Benin. RESULTS: A
      unique ORF with an internal translation stop was found in the patient isolate
      (Genbank access number : JN183870), while the K1 strain harboured the T1526C
      mutation (Genbank access number : JN183869) which affects the internal stop codon
      and restores a full length coding sequence. About 14% of isolates obtained from
      Senegal and Benin harboured mutant T1526C parasites. Some isolates had both wild 
      and mutant resa alleles. The analysis excluding those mixed isolates showed that 
      the resa2 T1526C mutation was found more frequently in severe malaria cases than 
      in uncomplicated cases (p = 0.008). The association of the presence of the mutant
      allele and parasitaemia >4% was shown in multivariate analysis (p = 0.03) in the 
      group of Beninese children. CONCLUSIONS: All T1526C mutant parasites
      theoretically have the ability to give rise to a full-length RESA2 protein. This 
      study raises the hypothesis that the RESA2 protein could favour high-density
      infections. Other studies in various geographic settings and probably including
      more patients are now required to replicate these results and to answer the
      questions raised by these results.

TI  - HMOX1 gene promoter alleles and high HO-1 levels are associated with severe
      malaria in Gambian children.
PG  - e1002579
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002579 [doi]
AB  - Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an essential enzyme induced by heme and multiple
      stimuli associated with critical illness. In humans, polymorphisms in the HMOX1
      gene promoter may influence the magnitude of HO-1 expression. In many diseases
      including murine malaria, HO-1 induction produces protective anti-inflammatory
      effects, but observations from patients suggest these may be limited to a narrow 
      range of HO-1 induction, prompting us to investigate the role of HO-1 in malaria 
      infection. In 307 Gambian children with either severe or uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria, we characterized the associations of HMOX1 promoter
      polymorphisms, HMOX1 mRNA inducibility, HO-1 protein levels in leucocytes (flow
      cytometry), and plasma (ELISA) with disease severity. The (GT)(n) repeat
      polymorphism in the HMOX1 promoter was associated with HMOX1 mRNA expression in
      white blood cells in vitro, and with severe disease and death, while high HO-1
      levels were associated with severe disease. Neutrophils were the main
      HO-1-expressing cells in peripheral blood, and HMOX1 mRNA expression was
      upregulated by heme-moieties of lysed erythrocytes. We provide mechanistic
      evidence that induction of HMOX1 expression in neutrophils potentiates the
      respiratory burst, and propose this may be part of the causal pathway explaining 
      the association between short (GT)(n) repeats and increased disease severity in
      malaria and other critical illnesses. Our findings suggest a genetic
      predisposition to higher levels of HO-1 is associated with severe illness, and
      enhances the neutrophil burst leading to oxidative damage of endothelial cells.
      These add important information to the discussion about possible therapeutic
      manipulation of HO-1 in critically ill patients.

TI  - Toll-like receptor polymorphisms and cerebral malaria: TLR2 Delta22 polymorphism 
      is associated with protection from cerebral malaria in a case control study.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-11-47 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic areas, host genetics influence whether a
      Plasmodium falciparum-infected child develops uncomplicated or severe malaria.
      TLR2 has been identified as a receptor for P. falciparum-derived
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), and polymorphisms within the TLR2 gene may
      affect disease pathogenesis. There are two common polymorphisms in the 5'
      un-translated region (UTR) of TLR2, a 22 base pair deletion in the first
      unstranslated exon (Delta22), and a GT dinucleotide repeat in the second intron
      (GTn). METHODS: These polymorphisms were examined in a Ugandan case control study
      on children with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria. Serum cytokine
      levels were analysed by ELISA, according to genotype and disease status. In vitro
      TLR2 expression was measured according to genotype. RESULTS: Both Delta22 and GTn
      polymorphisms were highly frequent, but only Delta22 heterozygosity was
      associated with protection from cerebral malaria (OR 0.34, 95% confidence
      intervals 0.16, 0.73). In vitro, heterozygosity for Delta22 was associated with
      reduced pam3cys inducible TLR2 expression in human monocyte derived macrophages. 
      In uncomplicated malaria patients, Delta22 homozygosity was associated with
      elevated serum IL-6 (p = 0.04), and long GT repeat alleles were associated with
      elevated TNF (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Reduced inducible TLR2 expression may lead 
      to attenuated pro-inflammatory responses, a potential mechanism of protection
      from cerebral malaria present in individuals heterozygous for the TLR2 Delta22
      polymorphism.

      polymorphisms on immunity and susceptibility to uncomplicated malaria and
      existence of marked linkage between the two polymorphisms in Daraweesh.
PG  - 537-44
LID - 10.1016/j.micinf.2012.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Malaria signature on human genome is marked by several gene polymorphisms.
      HemoglobinAS (HbAS) is known to protect against severe malaria, but barely proved
      to protect against uncomplicated malaria (UM). Similarly, the influence of
      FcgammaRIIa-RH131 polymorphism on malaria is controversial. Polymorphisms in both
      genes were examined and levels of IgG subclasses against four malaria antigens
      were measured for 250 Fulani's from Daraweesh, eastern Sudan. Morbidity data for 
      up to nine years was available for 214 donors. Number of malaria episodes
      experienced by each individual during the study period was used as indicator for 
      susceptibility to UM. PCR and RFLP were used for donors DNA genotyping and ELISA 
      for antibodies measurement. Results revealed that neither FcgammaRIIa-RH131
      alleles/genotypes nor HbAA/AS was significantly associated with malaria morbidity
      or with levels of IgG to test antigens. Both polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg
      Equilibrium, interestingly, there was strong association between the two
      polymorphisms (linkage disequilibrium - LD) with D' = 0.89. The association
      between the two polymorphisms was confirmed by analysis of independent material
      from a neighboring village. In conclusion, in Daraweesh both FcgammaRIIa-RH131
      and HbAA/AS genotypes, independently or together, were not major markers for UM
      susceptibility, however, marked LD was observed between the two polymorphisms.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the RNASE3 gene are associated with susceptibility to cerebral
      malaria in Ghanaian children.
PG  - e29465
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0029465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe outcome of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection and a major cause of death in children from 2 to 4 years of 
      age. A hospital based study in Ghana showed that P. falciparum induces
      eosinophilia and found a significantly higher serum level of eosinophil cationic 
      protein (ECP) in CM patients than in uncomplicated malaria (UM) and severe
      malaria anemia (SA) patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been
      described in the ECP encoding-gene (RNASE3) of which the c.371G>C polymorphism
      (rs2073342) results in an arginine to threonine amino acid substitution p.R124T
      in the polypeptide and abolishes the cytotoxicity of ECP. The present study aimed
      to investigate the potential association between polymorphisms in RNASE3 and CM. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The RNASE3 gene and flanking regions were
      sequenced in 206 Ghanaian children enrolled in a hospital based malaria study. An
      association study was carried out to assess the significance of five SNPs in CM
      (n=45) and SA (n=56) cases, respectively. The two severe case groups (CM and SA) 
      were compared with the non-severe control group comprising children suffering
      from UM (n=105). The 371G allele was significantly associated with CM (p=0.00945,
      OR=2.29, 95% CI=1.22-4.32) but not with SA. Linkage disequilibrium analysis
      demonstrated significant linkage between three SNPs and the haplotype combination
      371G/*16G/*94A was strongly associated with susceptibility to CM (p=0.000913,
      OR=4.14, 95% CI=1.79-9.56), thus, defining a risk haplotype. The RNASE3 371GG
      genotype was found to be under frequency-dependent selection.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 371G allele of RNASE3 is associated with
      susceptibility to CM and forms part of a risk associated haplotype GGA defined by
      the markers: rs2073342 (G-allele), rs2233860 (G-allele) and rs8019343 (A-allele) 
      respectively. Collectively, these results suggest a hitherto unrecognized role
      for eosinophils in CM pathogenesis.

AB  - The critical barrier in control of infections remains the failure of the immune
      system to clear parasites despite antigen recognition. We examined and validated 
      possible association of regulatory immune gene polymorphisms in a cohort of
      children with mild and severe malaria. We focussed on two precursors of the
      Interleukin 10 Receptor (IL10R) gene namely the IL10R alpha and IL10R beta that
      play a fundamental role in initiation of signal transduction. Initial screening
      across 40 Gabonese adult individuals revealed two promoter variants for the IL10R
      alpha and three for the IL10R beta precursor, respectively. Validation of these
      variants for their allelic gene expression by transient transfection assays
      exhibited an altered expression in rs56356146 and rs7925112 of the IL10R alpha (P
      < 0.5); rs8178435 and rs999788 in the IL10R beta constructs (P < 0.0001),
      respectively. We further investigated the functional role of those SNP variants
      exhibiting altered expression in a cohort of children with mild and severe
      malaria. We genotyped 145 children with mild and 185 children with severe malaria
      for IL10R alpha; for IL10R beta, 102 children with mild and 101 children with
      severe malaria. We found that none of the SNP variants had any significant
      association neither in children with mild or severe malaria. The haplotype
      -185/-116 of IL10R alpha (TT) in combination with the haplotype -754/-750 of
      IL10R beta (AC) contributed towards mild malaria in comparison to severe malaria 
      [TT + AC odds ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.56-0.94) P = 0.01]. This study may provide 
      a better understanding on the role of IL10R promoter allelic variants
      contribution to a protective effect on the development of severe malaria.

TI  - A -436C>A polymorphism in the human FAS gene promoter associated with severe
      childhood malaria.
PG  - e1002066
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002066 [doi]
AB  - Human genetics and immune responses are considered to critically influence the
      outcome of malaria infections including life-threatening syndromes caused by
      Plasmodium falciparum. An important role in immune regulation is assigned to the 
      apoptosis-signaling cell surface receptor CD95 (Fas, APO-1), encoded by the gene 
      FAS. Here, a candidate-gene association study including variant discovery at the 
      FAS gene locus was carried out in a case-control group comprising 1,195 pediatric
      cases of severe falciparum malaria and 769 unaffected controls from a region
      highly endemic for malaria in Ghana, West Africa. We found the A allele of
      c.-436C>A (rs9658676) located in the promoter region of FAS to be significantly
      associated with protection from severe childhood malaria (odds ratio 0.71, 95%
      confidence interval 0.58-0.88, p(empirical) = 0.02) and confirmed this finding in
      a replication group of 1,412 additional severe malaria cases and 2,659 community 
      controls from the same geographic area. The combined analysis resulted in an odds
      ratio of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.80, p = 1.8x10(-)(7), n = 6035).
      The association applied to c.-436AA homozygotes (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence 
      interval 0.36-0.60) and to a lesser extent to c.-436AC heterozygotes (odds ratio 
      0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.84), and also to all phenotypic subgroups
      studied, including severe malaria anemia, cerebral malaria, and other malaria
      complications. Quantitative FACS analyses assessing CD95 surface expression of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of naive donors showed a significantly higher 
      proportion of CD69+CD95+ cells among persons homozygous for the protective A
      allele compared to AC heterozygotes and CC homozygotes, indicating a functional
      role of the associated CD95 variant, possibly in supporting lymphocyte apoptosis.

AB  - Pre-erythrocytic immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria is likely to be
      mediated by T-cell recognition of malaria epitopes presented on infected host
      cells via class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. To test
      for associations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles with disease severity, 
      we performed high-resolution typing of HLA class I and II loci and compared the
      distributions of alleles of HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 loci in 359 Malian children
      of Dogon ethnicity with uncomplicated or severe malaria. We observed that alleles
      A*30:01 and A*33:01 had higher frequency in the group of patients with cerebral
      disease compared to patients with uncomplicated disease [A*30:01: gf = 0.2031 vs 
      gf = 0.1064, odds ratio (OR) = 3.17, P = 0.004, confidence interval (CI)
      (1.94-5.19)] and [A*33:01: gf = 0.0781 vs gf = 0.0266, 4.21, P = 0.005, CI
      (1.89-9.84)], respectively. The A*30:01 and A*33:01 alleles share some sequence
      motifs and A*30:01 appears to have a unique peptide binding repertoire compared
      to other A*30 group alleles. Computer algorithms predicted malaria peptides with 
      strong binding affinity for HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*33:01 but not to closely
      related alleles. In conclusion, we identified A*30:01 and A*33:01 as potential
      susceptibility factors for cerebral malaria, providing further evidence that
      polymorphism of MHC genes results in altered malaria susceptibility.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum clearance with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) 
      in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Mali.
PG  - 332
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently the most
      effective medicine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Artemisinin has
      previously been shown to increase the clearance of Plasmodium falciparum in
      malaria patients with haemoglobin E trait, but it did not increase parasite
      inhibition in an in vitro study using haemoglobin AS erythrocytes. The current
      study describes the efficacy of artemisinin derivatives on P. falciparum
      clearance in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), a
      haemoglobin enzyme deficiency, not yet studied in the same context, but
      nonetheless is a common in malaria endemic areas, associated with host protection
      against uncomplicated and severe malaria. The impact of G6PD deficiency on
      parasite clearance with ACT treatment was compared between G6PD-deficient
      patients and G6PD-normal group. METHODS: Blood samples from children and adults
      participants (1 to 70 years old) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria
      residing in Kambila, Mali were analysed. Study participants were randomly
      assigned to receive either artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem(R)) or artesunate
      plus mefloquine (Artequin). A restriction-fragment length polymorphism analysis
      of PCR-amplified DNA samples was used to identify the (A-) allele of the gene
      mutation responsible for G6PD deficiency (G6PD*A-). 470 blood samples were thus
      analysed and of these, DNA was extracted from 315 samples using the QIAamp kit
      for PCR to identify the G6PD*A- gene. RESULTS: The DNA amplified from 315 samples
      using PCR showed that G6PD*A- deficiency was present in 56 participants (17.8%). 
      The distribution of the specific deficiency was 1%, 7% and, 9.8% respectively for
      homozygous, hemizygous, and heterozygous genotypes. Before treatment, the median 
      parasitaemia and other baseline characteristics (mean haemoglobin, sex and age
      groups) between G6PD deficiency (hemizygous, heterozygous, and homozygous) and
      G6PD-normal participants were comparable (p > 0.05). After treatment, parasite
      clearance did not change significantly whether the participants were G6PD
      deficient or G6PD normal on day 1 (OR = 1.3; CI = 0.70-2.47; p > 0.05) and on day
      2 (OR = 0.859; CI = 0.097-7.61; p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of G6PD
      deficiency does not appear to significantly influence the clearance of P.
      falciparum in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria using ACT.

TI  - Limited ability of Plasmodium falciparum pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfnhe1 polymorphisms 
      to predict quinine in vitro sensitivity or clinical effectiveness in Uganda.
PG  - 615-22
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00954-10 [doi]
AB  - Quinine is a standard drug for treating severe malaria in Africa, and it is also 
      increasingly used to treat uncomplicated disease. However, failures of quinine
      therapy are common, and it is unknown if failures in Africa are due to drug
      resistance. Recent studies have identified associations between in vitro quinine 
      sensitivity and polymorphisms in genes encoding putative transporters, including 
      well-described polymorphisms in pfcrt and pfmdr1 and varied numbers of DNNND or
      DDNHNDNHNND repeats in microsatellite 4760 (ms4760) of the predicted
      sodium-hydrogen exchanger, pfnhe1. To better characterize mediators of quinine
      response, we assessed associations between genetic polymorphisms, in vitro
      quinine sensitivity, and quinine treatment responses in Kampala, Uganda. Among
      172 fresh clinical isolates tested in vitro, decreasing sensitivity to quinine
      was associated with accumulation of pfmdr1 mutations at codons 86, 184, and 1246.
      Nearly all parasites had pfcrt 76T, preventing analysis of associations with this
      mutation. pfnhe1 ms4760 was highly polymorphic. Parasites with 2 copies of either
      ms4760 repeat showed modest decreases in quinine sensitivity compared to those
      with 1 or >/=3 repeats, but the differences were not statistically significant.
      None of the above polymorphisms predicted treatment failure among 66 subjects
      treated with quinine for uncomplicated malaria. Our data suggest that quinine
      sensitivity is a complex trait and that known polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
      pfnhe1, while associated with quinine sensitivity, are not robust markers for
      quinine resistance.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta 2 and heme oxygenase 1 genes are risk factors for
      the cerebral malaria syndrome in Angolan children.
PG  - e11141
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) represents a severe outcome of the Plasmodium
      falciparum infection. Recent genetic studies have correlated human genes with
      severe malaria susceptibility, but there is little data on genetic variants that 
      increase the risk of developing specific malaria clinical complications.
      Nevertheless, susceptibility to experimental CM in the mouse has been linked to
      host genes including Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2 (TGFB2) and Heme
      oxygenase-1 (HMOX1). Here, we tested whether those genes were governing the risk 
      of progressing to CM in patients with severe malaria syndromes.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that the clinical outcome of P.
      falciparum infection in a cohort of Angolan children (n = 430) correlated with
      nine TGFB2 SNPs that modify the risk of progression to CM as compared to other
      severe forms of malaria. This genetic effect was explained by two haplotypes
      harboring the CM-associated SNPs (Pcorrec. = 0.035 and 0.036). In addition, one
      HMOX1 haplotype composed of five CM-associated SNPs increased the risk of
      developing the CM syndrome (Pcorrec. = 0.002) and was under-transmitted to
      children with uncomplicated malaria (P = 0.036). Notably, the HMOX1-associated
      haplotype conferred increased HMOX1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells of 
      CM patients (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results represent the
      first report on CM genetic risk factors in Angolan children and suggest the novel
      hypothesis that genetic variants of the TGFB2 and HMOX1 genes may contribute to
      confer a specific risk of developing the CM syndrome in patients with severe P.
      falciparum malaria. This work may provide motivation for future studies aiming to
      replicate our findings in larger populations and to confirm a role for these
      genes in determining the clinical course of malaria.

TI  - Child hospitalization due to severe malaria is associated with the ICAM-1Kilifi
      allele but not adherence patterns of Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood
      cells to ICAM-1.
PG  - 45-50
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.05.006 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed at determining whether the predisposition of a mutation at
      position 179 of the ICAM-1 gene to child hospitalization due to malaria was
      mediated by changes in adherence properties of IRBCs to ICAM-1. ICAM-1 genotypes 
      were determined by nested polymerase chain reaction of isolated DNA from filter
      blood spots followed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).
      Plasmodium falciparum adherence assays were done on immobilized purified ICAM-1. 
      Our data indicate that the homozygosity for the ICAM-1(Kilifi) mutation occurs at
      a frequency of 22.3% in Magugu-Babati, Northern Tanzania. Our results show that
      there are no differences in IRBC binding profiles across genotypes. We show in
      this study that homozygosity for the ICAM-1(Kilifi) is associated with child
      hospitalization (X(2)=14.47, p<0.001). We have further shown that hospitalization
      was not associated with cytoadherence (X(2)=0.17, p=0.68). We conclude that the
      ICAM-1(Kilifi) allele occurs at a high frequency in Tanzania and that
      associations of this allele with higher child hospitalization frequencies is
      independent of cytoadherence patterns of IRBC isolated from ICAM-1 genotypes,
      implying that any associations reported to exist between the ICAM-1(Kilifi)
      mutation and severe malaria are unlikely to be mediated through altered IRBC
      cytoadherence properties.

TI  - Parasite polymorphism and severe malaria in Dakar (Senegal): a West African urban
      area.
PG  - e9817
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0009817 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmission of malaria in West African urban areas is low and
      healthcare facilities are well organized. However, malaria mortality remains
      high. We conducted a survey in Dakar with the general objective to establish who 
      died from severe malaria (SM) in urban areas (particularly looking at the
      age-groups) and to compare parasite isolates associated with mild or severe
      malaria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The current study included mild- (MM)
      and severe malaria (SM) cases, treated in dispensaries (n = 2977) and hospitals
      (n = 104), We analysed Pfdhfr/Pfcrt-exon2 and nine microsatellite loci in 102
      matched cases of SM and MM. Half of the malaria cases recorded at the
      dispensaries and 87% of SM cases referred to hospitals, occurred in adults,
      although adults only accounted for 26% of all dispensary consultations. This
      suggests that, in urban settings, whatever the reason for this adult
      over-representation, health-workers are forced to take care of increasing numbers
      of malaria cases among adults. Inappropriate self treatment and mutations in
      genes associated with drug resistance were found associated with SM in adults. SM
      was also associated with a specific pool of isolates highly polymorphic and
      different from those associated with MM. CONCLUSION: In this urban setting,
      adults currently represent one of the major groups of patients attending
      dispensaries for malaria treatment. For these patients, despite the low level of 
      transmission, SM was associated with a specific and highly polymorphic pool of
      parasites which may have been selected by inappropriate treatment.

TI  - FCGR2A functional genetic variant associated with susceptibility to severe
      malarial anaemia in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 471-5
LID - 10.1136/jmg.2009.073643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe malarial anaemia is a major cause of mortality from malaria.
      Although of enormous relevance, its pathogenesis is largely unknown.
      Interestingly, the extent of anaemia greatly exceeds the loss of erythrocytes due
      to direct destruction by the pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Immune response
      against the parasite is partially mediated through the Fc receptor for
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G IIa (FcgammaRIIa, CD32). The presence of an arginine
      instead of a histidine residue at amino acid position 131 (H131R) in the
      extracellular domain of FcgammaRIIa reduces the affinity of the receptor for
      IgG(2) and IgG(3) isotypes but increases the binding activity for C reactive
      protein (CRP). METHODS: In Ghana, West Africa, 2504 children with severe malaria 
      and 2027 matched healthy controls were studied for the FcgammaRIIa(H131R)
      polymorphism in order to ascertain its influence on major manifestations of the
      disease. The study group included patients with partly overlapping symptoms of
      severe malaria, among them 1591 cases with severe anaemia, 562 cases with
      cerebral malaria, and 497 cases with other malaria complications. RESULTS:
      Analyses of the genotype distributions indicated that, under a recessive model,
      FcgammaRIIa(131RR) was positively associated with severe malaria collectively (OR
      1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.38; p=0.007, p(corrected)=0.021) and, after stratification
      for phenotypes, with severe anaemia (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; p=0.001,
      p(corrected)=0.009), but not with cerebral malaria (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.33;
      p=0.733) or other malaria complications (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; p=0.827). 
      No association was found with levels of parasitaemia. CONCLUSION: The positive
      association with a CRP binding variant of FcgammaRIIa supports evidence for a
      role of CRP mediated defence mechanisms in the pathogenesis of severe malarial
      anaemia.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) mediates host resistance to severe malaria and other infectious
      diseases. NO production and mononuclear cell expression of the NO producing
      enzyme-inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) have been associated with
      protection from severe falciparum malaria. The purpose of this study was to
      identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the NOS2
      promoter, to identify associations of these haplotypes with malaria severity and 
      to test the effects of these polymorphisms on promoter activity. We identified 34
      SNPs in the proximal 7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and inferred NOS2
      promoter haplotypes based on genotyping 24 of these SNPs in a population of
      Tanzanian children with and without cerebral malaria. We identified 71
      haplotypes; 24 of these haplotypes comprised 82% of the alleles. We determined
      whether NOS2 promoter haplotypes were associated with malaria severity in two
      groups of subjects from Dar es Salaam (N = 185 and N = 250) and in an inception
      cohort of children from Muheza-Tanga, Tanzania (N = 883). We did not find
      consistent associations of NOS2 promoter haplotypes with malaria severity or
      malarial anemia, although interpretation of these results was potentially limited
      by the sample size of each group. Furthermore, cytokine-induced NOS2 promoter
      activity determined using luciferase reporter constructs containing the proximal 
      7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and the G-954C or C-1173T SNPs did not differ 
      from NOS2 promoter constructs that lacked these polymorphisms. Taken together,
      these studies suggest that the relationship between NOS2 promoter polymorphisms
      and malaria severity is more complex than previously described.

TI  - Analysis of malaria associated genetic traits in Cabo Verde, a melting pot of
      European and sub Saharan settlers.

LID - 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Malaria has occurred in the Cabo Verde archipelago with epidemic characteristics 
      since its colonization. Nowadays, it occurs in Santiago Island alone and though
      prophylaxis is not recommended by the World Health Organization, studies have
      highlight the prospect of malaria becoming a serious public health problem as a
      result of the presence of antimalarial drug resistance associated with mutations 
      in the parasite populations and underscore the need for tighter surveillance.
      Despite the presumptive weak immune status of the population, severe symptoms of 
      malaria are not observed and many people present a subclinical course of the
      disease. No data on the prevalence of sickle-cell trait and red cell
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (two classical genetic factors
      associated with resistance to severe malaria) were available for the Cabo Verde
      archipelago and, therefore, we studied the low morbidity from malaria in relation
      to the particular genetic characteristics of the human host population. We also
      included the analysis of the pyruvate kinase deficiency associated gene, reported
      as putatively associated with resistance to the disease. Allelic frequencies of
      the polymorphisms examined are closer to European than to African populations and
      no malaria selection signatures were found. No association was found between the 
      analyzed human factors and infection but one result is of high interest: a
      linkage disequilibrium test revealed an association of distant loci in the PKLR
      gene and adjacent regions, only in non-infected individuals. This could mean a
      more conserved gene region selected in association to protection against the
      infection and/or the disease.

TI  - Genetic evidence for the aggravation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by
      interleukin 4.
PG  - 1530-9
LID - 10.1086/644600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe malaria (SM) due to Plasmodium falciparum causes millions of
      child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. It comprises a variety of clinical disorders,
      including cerebral malaria (CM) and severe anemia (SA). In previous work, we have
      shown that interferon gamma and interleukin 12 protect against CM. Here, we
      investigated whether interleukin 4 (IL-4) aggravates the risk of severe disease. 
      METHODS: We prospectively recruited children with CM (n = 240), SA (n = 101), and
      uncomplicated malaria (UM) (n = 42) in Bamako, Mali, and measured IL-4 production
      in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We then assessed the influence of
      11 polymorphisms on predisposition to SM by the family-based association test
      (FBAT). RESULTS: IL-4 concentrations were higher in children with CM than in
      children with UM during malaria (P = .003). FBAT analyses showed that the most
      significant association was between the IL4 variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) 
      1/2 genotype and SM (P < .001); an association was also observed for IL4 -33 C/T,
      rs2243267 G/C, rs2243268 C/A, and rs2243282 C/A (P < .05). Interestingly, we
      found that the plasma concentration of IL-4 was higher in subjects with the IL4
      VNTR 1/2 or 1/1 genotype than with the IL4 VNTR 2/2 genotype (P = .003).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results support the view that IL-4 may be a risk factor for
      SM. IL-4 may aggravate the disease by interfering with type 1 T helper cell
      differentiation or by promoting local inflammation at sites of parasite
      sequestration.

TI  - Common genotypic polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferases in mild and severe
      falciparum malaria in Tanzanian children.
PG  - 363-5
AB  - Malaria infection induces oxidative stress in the host cells. Antioxidant enzymes
      such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are responsible for fighting reactive
      oxygen species and reduction of oxidative stress. Common GST polymorphisms have
      been associated with susceptibility to different diseases whose pathologies
      involve oxidative stress. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that GST
      polymorphisms that lead to reduced or lack of enzyme activity are associated with
      severe Plasmodium falciparum malarial anemia. We studied the genotypic
      distribution of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms between mild malaria (N =
      107) and severe malarial anemia (N = 50) in Tanzanian children. We did not find a
      significant relationship with the GSTT1 polymorphism. GSTM1-null was higher in
      the severe malaria anemia group but the difference was not significant (P =
      0.08). However, a significant association of GSTP1 I105V genotype with severe
      malarial anemia was discovered (26.0% against 10.3% mild malaria, P = 0.004). We 
      concluded that GSTP1 and possibly GSTM1 may protect against severe falciparum
      malaria in children.

TI  - Genome-wide and fine-resolution association analysis of malaria in West Africa.
PG  - 657-65
LID - 10.1038/ng.388 [doi]
AB  - We report a genome-wide association (GWA) study of severe malaria in The Gambia. 
      The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K
      GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to
      examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable
      population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria 
      resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium
      (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on
      the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and
      then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This
      increased the signal of association, from P = 4 x 10(-7) to P = 4 x 10(-14), with
      the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings 
      provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on
      population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA
      signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations.

TI  - Haplotype specific-sequencing reveals MBL2 association with asymptomatic
      Plasmodium falciparum infection.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-8-97 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mannose binding lectin (MBL) has an important role in the activation 
      of the complement system and opsonization of pathogenic microorganisms. Frequent 
      polymorphisms found in the MBL2 gene affect the concentration and functionality
      of the protein and are associated with enhanced susceptibility to severe malaria 
      in African children. Most MBL2 typing strategies were designed to the analysis of
      selected variants, the significance of whole haplotypes is poorly known. In this 
      work, a new typing strategy was developed and validated in an association
      analysis of MBL2 with adult asymptomatic infection. METHODS: MBL2 allele-specific
      fragments of 144 healthy Gabonese adults were amplified by using
      haplotype-specific sequencing (HSS), a new strategy that combines
      sequence-specific PCR and sequence-based typing. The Gabonese were investigated
      for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia by the amplification of
      parasite genes, immunochromatographic antigen detection and microscopic analysis.
      HSS results were also compared with a previously used real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
      method in 72 Euro-Brazilians. RESULTS: Fourteen polymorphisms were identified
      beside the commonly investigated promoter (H, L; X, Y; P, Q) and exon 1 (A, O; O 
      = B, C or D) variants. The MBL2*LYPA/LYPA genotype was associated with the
      absence of asymptomatic infection (P = 0.017), whereas the MBL2*LYQC haplotype
      and YA/YO + YO/YO genotypes were associated with positive parasite counts in
      asymptomatic adults (P = 0.033 and 0.018, respectively). The associations were
      specific to LYPA (identical to the reference sequence Y16577) and LYQC (Y16578)
      and would not have been revealed by standard genotyping, as there was no
      association with LYPA and LYQC haplotypes carrying new polymorphisms defined by
      sequence-based typing. In contrast, HSS and RT-PCR produced very similar results 
      in the less diverse European-derived population. CONCLUSION: In this work, a new 
      typing strategy for a highly polymorphic gene was developed and validated
      focusing on the asymptomatic status of P. falciparum-infected adults. In
      populations with high nucleotide diversity, it allowed for the identification of 
      associations with fine-scaled haplotypes that would not have been found using
      common typing techniques. In this preliminary study, MBL2 haplotypes or SNPs
      linked to them were found associated with susceptibility to infection and
      parasitaemia control of asymptomatic adults.

      through induction with plasmodium DNA or another malaria motif not yet
      identified. Although TLR9 activation by malaria parasites is well reported, the
      implication to the susceptibility to severe malaria is not clear. The aim of this
      study was to assess the contribution of genetic variation at TLR9 to severe
      malaria. METHODS: This study explores the contribution of TLR9 genetic variants
      to severe malaria using two approaches. First, an association study of four
      common single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed on both family- and
      population-based studies from Malawian and Gambian populations (n>6000
      individual). Subsequently, it was assessed whether TLR9 expression is affected by
      cis-acting variants and if these variants could be mapped. For this work, an
      allele specific expression (ASE) assay on a panel of HapMap cell lines was
      carried out. RESULTS: No convincing association was found with polymorphisms in
      TLR9 for malaria severity, in either Gambian or Malawian populations, using both 
      case-control and family based study designs. Using an allele specific expression 
      assay it was observed that TLR9 expression is affected by cis-acting variants,
      these results were replicated in a second experiment using biological replicates.
      CONCLUSION: By using the largest cohorts analysed to date, as well as a
      standardized phenotype definition and study design, no association of TLR9
      genetic variants with severe malaria was found. This analysis considered all
      common variants in the region, but it is remains possible that there are rare
      variants with association signals. This report also shows that TLR9 expression is
      potentially modulated through cis-regulatory variants, which may lead to
      differential inflammatory responses to infection between individuals.

AB  - The tumor necrosis factor gene (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha gene (LTA) have long
      attracted attention as candidate genes for susceptibility traits for malaria, and
      several of their polymorphisms have been found to be associated with severe
      malaria (SM) phenotypes. In a large study involving >10,000 individuals and
      encompassing 3 African populations, we found evidence to support the reported
      associations between the TNF -238 polymorphism and SM in The Gambia. However, no 
      TNF/LTA polymorphisms were found to be associated with SM in cohorts in Kenya and
      Malawi. It has been suggested that the causal polymorphisms regulating the TNF
      and LTA responses may be located some distance from the genes. Therefore,
      more-detailed mapping of variants across TNF/LTA genes and their flanking regions
      in the Gambian and allied populations may need to be undertaken to find any
      causal polymorphisms.

      susceptibility.
PG  - 1080-5
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2009.8 [doi]
AB  - Several lines of evidence link glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
      deficiency to protection from severe malaria. Early reports suggested most G6PD
      deficiency in sub-Saharan Africa was because of the 202A/376G G6PD A- allele, and
      recent association studies of G6PD deficiency have employed genotyping as a
      convenient way to determine enzyme status. However, further work has suggested
      that other G6PD deficiency alleles are relatively common in some regions of West 
      Africa. To investigate the consequences of unrecognized allelic heterogeneity on 
      association studies, in particular studies of G6PD deficiency and malaria, we
      carried out a case-control analysis of 2488 Gambian children with severe malaria 
      and 3875 controls. No significant association was found between severe malaria
      and the 202A/376G G6PD A- allele when analyzed alone, but pooling 202A/376G with 
      other deficiency alleles revealed the signal of protection (male odds ratio (OR) 
      0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.95, P=0.016; female OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.89, P=0.004). We
      have identified the 968C mutation as the most common G6PD A- allele in The
      Gambia. Our results highlight some of the consequences of allelic heterogeneity, 
      particularly the increased type I error. They also suggest that G6PD-deficient
      male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected from severe malaria.

TI  - Lack of association of interferon regulatory factor 1 with severe malaria in
      affected child-parental trio studies across three African populations.
PG  - e4206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004206 [doi]
AB  - Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF-1) is a member of the IRF family of
      transcription factors, which have key and diverse roles in the gene-regulatory
      networks of the immune system. IRF-1 has been described as a critical mediator of
      IFN-gamma signalling and as the major player in driving TH1 type responses. It is
      therefore likely to be crucial in both innate and adaptive responses against
      intracellular pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum. Polymorphisms at the human
      IRF1 locus have been previously found to be associated with the ability to
      control P. falciparum infection in populations naturally exposed to malaria. In
      order to test whether genetic variation at the IRF1 locus also affects the risk
      of developing severe malaria, we performed a family-based test of association for
      18 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the gene in three African
      populations, using genotype data from 961 trios consisting of one affected child 
      and his/her two parents (555 from The Gambia, 204 from Kenya and 202 from
      Malawi). No significant association with severe malaria or severe malaria
      subphenotypes (cerebral malaria and severe malaria anaemia) was observed for any 
      of the SNPs/haplotypes tested in any of the study populations. Our results offer 
      no evidence that the molecular pathways regulated by the transcription factor
      IRF-1 are involved in the immune-based pathogenesis of severe malaria.

PG  - 499-506
LID - 10.1007/s00439-008-0575-8 [doi]
AB  - Functional studies have demonstrated an interaction between the stimulatory G
      protein alpha subunit (G-alpha-s) and the malaria parasite at a cellular level.
      Obstruction of signal transduction via the erythrocyte G-alpha-s subunit reduced 
      invasion by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. We sought to determine whether this 
      signal pathway had an impact at the disease level by testing polymorphisms in the
      gene encoding G-alpha-s (GNAS) for association with severe malaria in a large
      multi-centre study encompassing family and case-control studies from The Gambia, 
      Kenya and Malawi, and a case-control study from Ghana. We gained power to detect 
      association using meta-analysis across the seven studies, with an overall sample 
      size approximating 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls. Out of 12 SNPs investigated in
      the 19 kb GNAS region, four presented signals of association (P < 0.05) with
      severe malaria. The strongest single-locus association demonstrated an odds ratio
      of 1.13 (1.05-1.21), P = 0.001. Three of the loci presenting significant
      associations were clustered at the 5-prime end of the GNAS gene. Accordingly,
      haplotypes constructed from these loci demonstrated significant associations with
      severe malaria [OR = 0.88 (0.81-0.96), P = 0.005 and OR = 1.12 (1.03-1.20), P =
      0.005]. The evidence presented here indicates that the influence of G-alpha-s on 
      erythrocyte invasion efficacy may, indeed, alter individual susceptibility to
      disease.

AB  - Evidence from autopsy and in vitro binding studies suggests that adhesion of
      erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum to the human host intercellular 
      adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 receptor is important in the pathogenesis of severe
      malaria. Previous association studies between polymorphisms in the ICAM1 gene and
      susceptibility to severe malarial phenotypes have been inconclusive and often
      contradictory. We performed genetic association studies with 15 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) around the ICAM1 locus. All SNPs were screened in a family
      study of 1071 trios from The Gambia, Malawi and Kenya. Two key non-synonymous
      SNPs with previously reported associations, rs5491 (K56M or 'ICAM-1(Kilifi)') and
      rs5498 (K469E), were tested in an additional 708 Gambian trios and a case-control
      study of 4058 individuals. None of the polymorphisms were associated with severe 
      malaria phenotypes. Pooled results across our studies for ICAM-1(Kilifi) were, in
      severe malaria, odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.09,
      P=0.54, and cerebral malaria OR 1.07, CI 0.97-1.17, P=0.17. We assess the
      available epidemiological, population genetic and functional evidence that links 
      ICAM-1(Kilifi) to severe malaria susceptibility.

TI  - Reduced risk of uncomplicated malaria episodes in children with
      alpha+-thalassemia in northeastern Tanzania.
PG  - 714-20
AB  - The prevalence of human red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms is high in areas of
      intense Plasmodium falciparum transmission, and individuals carrying these
      genetic traits are believed to be partially protected against severe malaria.
      However, it remains uncertain how RBC polymorphisms affect the susceptibility to 
      uncomplicated malaria. We compared the risk of suffering from febrile,
      uncomplicated malaria between individuals carrying three common RBC polymorphisms
      (sickle cell trait, alpha(+)-thalassemia, and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase
      deficiency) and controls. The study was performed in an area of intense malaria
      transmission where 202 individuals 0-19 years of age were monitored clinically
      for a period of 6 months. RBC polymorphisms were assessed with molecular methods,
      and plasma antibodies to P. falciparum variant surface antigens (anti-VSA IgG)
      and glutamate-rich protein (anti-GLURP IgG) were measured with flow cytometry and
      ELISA assays, respectively. Regression analyses showed that alpha(+)-thalassemia 
      was associated with a reduced risk of uncomplicated malaria episodes and that
      this advantageous effect seemed to be more predominant in children older than 5
      years of age, but was independent of levels of antibodies to VSA and GLURP.

TI  - IL12B polymorphisms are linked but not associated with Plasmodium falciparum
      parasitemia: a familial study in Burkina Faso.
PG  - 405-11
LID - 10.1038/gene.2008.31 [doi]
AB  - Chromosome 5q31-q33 has been linked to Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in
      several independent studies. This chromosomal region contains numerous
      immunoregulatory genes. Among these, IL12B that encodes the p40 subunit of
      interleukin-12 (IL-12) appeared to be a promising functional candidate gene, and 
      IL12Bpro, a promoter polymorphism, was associated with mortality from severe
      malaria in children. In this study, we characterized genetic variation in IL12B
      in 215 individuals belonging to 34 families and evaluated linkage and association
      of parasitemia with IL12B polymorphisms and haplotypes. We searched for IL12B
      polymorphisms in the coding regions and the corresponding intron-exon borders. We
      also examined IL12Bpro and IL12B 3'untranslated region (UTR) polymorphisms, which
      are thought to influence the production of IL-12. We showed a high level of
      conservation of IL12B-coding regions and identified five polymorphisms in introns
      and the two polymorphisms in the promoter and the 3'UTR regions. Although IL12B
      polymorphisms were linked to parasitemia, there was association of parasitemia
      with neither polymorphisms nor haplotypes. We cannot exclude that an unknown
      IL12B cis-regulatory element polymorphism affects both IL-12 production and
      parasitemia. However, our results suggest that genetic variation in IL12B does
      not explain differences in parasitemia in individuals living in an endemic area.

TI  - Mannose-binding lectin variant associated with severe malaria in young African
      children.
PG  - 342-8
LID - 10.1016/j.micinf.2007.12.008 [doi]
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein which initiates innate immune
      responses to microbial pathogens by binding to non-self surface oligosaccharides.
      MBL deficiency is the most common congenital immunodeficiency of human and has
      been shown to predispose to infections, particularly in children and immune
      compromised. In a matched case-control study among 870 Ghanaian children, we
      examined the influence of six polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene on Plasmodium
      falciparum infection and severe malaria. A missense mutation resulting in low MBL
      activity (MBL2*C) was found in 35% of healthy controls, but in 42% of
      asymptomatically infected children (P=0.01), and in 46% of patients with severe
      malaria (P=0.007). Heterozygosity for MBL2*C was associated with increased odds
      of infection (odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.1),
      severe malaria (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), and of severe anemia in particular
      (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8). The population attributable fraction of severe
      malaria cases attributable to MBL2*C heterozygosity was 17%. Our results suggest 
      that the MBL pathway of the complement system is a critical determinant of both, 
      susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and manifestation of severe malaria,
      particularly in young children in whom specific immune responses are weak or
      absent.

TI  - Polymorphisms of TNF-enhancer and gene for FcgammaRIIa correlate with the
      severity of falciparum malaria in the ethnically diverse Indian population.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-7-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Susceptibility/resistance to Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been
      correlated with polymorphisms in more than 30 human genes with most association
      analyses having been carried out on patients from Africa and south-east Asia. The
      aim of this study was to examine the possible contribution of genetic variants in
      the TNF and FCGR2A genes in determining severity/resistance to P. falciparum
      malaria in Indian subjects. METHODS: Allelic frequency distribution in
      populations across India was first determined by typing genetic variants of the
      TNF enhancer and the FCGR2A G/A SNP in 1871 individuals from 55 populations.
      Genotyping was carried out by DNA sequencing, single base extension (SNaPshot),
      and DNA mass array (Sequenom). Plasma TNF was determined by ELISA. Comparison of 
      datasets was carried out by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Haplotypes and
      LD plots were generated by PHASE and Haploview, respectively. Odds ratio (OR) for
      risk assessment was calculated using EpiInfotrade mark version 3.4. RESULTS: A
      novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -76 was identified in the 
      TNF enhancer along with other reported variants. Five TNF enhancer SNPs and the
      FCGR2A R131H (G/A) SNP were analyzed for association with severity of P.
      falciparum malaria in a malaria-endemic and a non-endemic region of India in a
      case-control study with ethnically-matched controls enrolled from both regions.
      TNF -1031C and -863A alleles as well as homozygotes for the TNF enhancer
      haplotype CACGG (-1031T>C, -863C>A, -857C>T, -308G>A, -238G>A) correlated with
      enhanced plasma TNF levels in both patients and controls. Significantly higher
      TNF levels were observed in patients with severe malaria. Minor alleles of -1031 
      and -863 SNPs were associated with increased susceptibility to severe malaria.
      The high-affinity IgG2 binding FcgammaRIIa AA (131H) genotype was significantly
      associated with protection from disease manifestation, with stronger association 
      observed in the malaria non-endemic region. These results represent the first
      genetic analysis of the two immune regulatory molecules in the context of P.
      falciparum severity/resistance in the Indian population. CONCLUSION: Association 
      of specific TNF and FCGR2A SNPs with cytokine levels and disease
      severity/resistance was indicated in patients from areas with differential
      disease endemicity. The data emphasizes the need for addressing the contribution 
      of human genetic factors in malaria in the context of disease epidemiology and
      population genetic substructure within India.

TI  - Common variation in the ABO glycosyltransferase is associated with susceptibility
      to severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 567-76
AB  - There is growing epidemiological and molecular evidence that ABO blood group
      affects host susceptibility to severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. The high
      frequency of common ABO alleles means that even modest differences in
      susceptibility could have a significant impact on the health of people living in 
      malaria endemic regions. We performed an association study, the first to utilize 
      key molecular genetic variation underlying the ABO system, genotyping >9000
      individuals across three African populations. Using population- and family-based 
      tests, we demonstrated that alleles producing functional ABO enzymes are
      associated with greater risk of severe malaria phenotypes (particularly malarial 
      anemia) in comparison with the frameshift deletion underlying blood group O:
      case-control allelic odds ratio (OR), 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI),
      1.09-1.32; P = 0.0003; family-studies allelic OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; P =
      0.001; pooled across all studies allelic OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26; P = 2 x
      10(-7). We found suggestive evidence of a parent-of-origin effect at the ABO
      locus by analyzing the family trios. Non-O haplotypes inherited from mothers, but
      not fathers, are significantly associated with severe malaria (likelihood ratio
      test of Weinberg, P = 0.046). Finally, we used HapMap data to demonstrate a
      region of low F(ST) (-0.001) between the three main HapMap population groups
      across the ABO locus, an outlier in the empirical distribution of F(ST) across
      chromosome 9 (approximately 99.5-99.9th centile). This low F(ST) region may be a 
      signal of long-standing balancing selection at the ABO locus, caused by multiple 
      infectious pathogens including P. falciparum.

TI  - Positive replication and linkage disequilibrium mapping of the chromosome 21q22.1
      malaria susceptibility locus.
PG  - 570-6
AB  - Four cytokine receptor genes are located on Chr21q22.11, encoding the alpha and
      beta subunits of the interferon-alpha receptor (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2), the beta
      subunit of the interleukin 10 receptor (IL10RB) and the second subunit of the
      interferon-gamma receptor (IFNGR2). We previously reported that two variants in
      IFNAR1 were associated with susceptibility to malaria in Gambians. We now present
      an extensive fine-scale mapping of the associated region utilizing 45 additional 
      genetic markers obtained from public databases and by sequencing a 44 kb region
      in and around the IFNAR1 gene in 24 Gambian children (12 cases/12 controls).
      Within the IFNAR1 gene, a newly studied C --> G single-nucleotide polymorphism
      (IFNAR1 272354c-g) at position -576 relative to the transcription start was found
      to be more strongly associated with susceptibility to severe malaria. Association
      was observed in three populations: in Gambian (P=0.002), Kenyan (P=0.022) and
      Vietnamese (P=0.005) case-control studies. When all three studies were combined, 
      using the Mantel-Haenszel test, the presence of IFNAR1 -576G was associated with 
      a substantially elevated risk of severe malaria (N=2444, OR=1.38, 95% CI:
      1.17-1.64; P=1.7 x 10(-4)). This study builds on previous work to further
      highlight the importance of the type-I interferon pathway in malaria
      susceptibility and illustrates the utility of typing SNPs within regions of high 
      linkage disequilibrium in multiple populations to confirm initial positive
      associations.

TI  - Fc gamma receptor IIa (CD32) polymorphism and antibody responses to asexual
      blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Sudanese patients.
PG  - 87-96
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2007.01947.x [doi]
AB  - In a prospective clinical study in New Halfa Teaching Hospital, the possible
      association between FcgammaRIIa-R/H131 polymorphism and anti-malarial antibody
      responses with clinical outcome of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among Sudanese
      patients was investigated. A total of 256 individuals were consecutively
      enrolled, comprising 115 patients with severe malaria, 85 with mild malaria and
      56 malaria-free controls. Genotyping of FcgammaRIIa-R/H131 dimorphism was
      performed using gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with 
      allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product. The antibody
      responses to asexual blood-stage antigens were assessed by an enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. The frequency of the FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype was
      significantly higher in those with severe malaria when compared with patients
      with mild malaria, while the FcgammaRIIa-H/H131 genotype showed a significant
      association with mild malaria. A reduced risk of severe malaria with IgG3
      antibodies in combination with the H/H131 genotype was observed. Furthermore, low
      levels of IgG2 antibodies reactive with the Pf332-C231 antigen were also
      associated with lower risk of severe malaria in individuals carrying the H131
      allele. The levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were statistically significantly
      higher in the mild malaria patients when compared with the severe malaria
      patients. Taken together, our study revealed that the FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype
      is associated with the development of severe malaria, while the H/H131 genotype
      is more likely to be associated with mild malaria. Our results also revealed that
      the natural acquisition of immunity against clinical malaria appeared to be more 
      associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, signifying their roles in
      parasite-neutralizing immune mechanisms.

TI  - Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms in African children: common TLR-4 variants
      predispose to severe malaria.
PG  - 230-45
AB  - Genetic host factors play a substantial role in susceptibility to and severity of
      malaria, which continues to cause at least one million deaths per year. Recently,
      members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family have been shown to be involved in 
      recognition of the etiologic organism Plasmodium falciparum: The
      glycosylphosphatidylinisitol anchor induces signaling in host cells via TLR-2 and
      -4, while hemozoin-induced immune activation involves TLR-9. Binding of microbial
      ligands to the respective TLRs triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      via the TLR/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain and may contribute to the host response,
      including pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and malarial fever. In a
      case-control study among 870 Ghanaian children, we examined the influence of
      TLR-2, -4, and -9 polymorphisms in susceptibility to severe malaria. TLR-2
      variants common in Caucasians and Asians were completely absent. However, we
      found a new, rare mutation (Leu658Pro), which impairs signaling via TLR-2. We
      failed to detect any polymorphisms within the TLR-9/interleukin-1 receptor
      domain. Two frequent TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms did not show a clear
      association with malaria severity. In contrast, the TLR-4-Asp299Gly variant
      occurred at a high rate of 17.6% in healthy controls, and was even more frequent 
      in severe malaria patients (24.1%, p<0.05). Likewise, TLR-4-Thr399Ile was seen in
      2.4% of healthy children and in 6.2% of patients (p=0.02). TLR-4-Asp299Gly and
      TLR-4-Thr399Ile conferred an 1.5- and 2.6-fold increased risk of severe malaria, 
      respectively. These findings suggest TLR4-mediated responses to malaria in vivo
      and TLR-4 polymorphisms to be associated with disease manifestation. However some
      gray areas also suggest the scope for further improvements.

PG  - 363-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 776C-->G variant (dbSNP ID: rs1801198) in the transcobalamin gene
      (TCN2; MIM# 275350) decreases the cellular and plasma concentration of
      transcobalamin and thereby influences the cellular availability of vitamin B(12).
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the worldwide prevalence of this variant and its
      association with homocysteine plasma level. METHODS: The study was performed in
      1433 apparently healthy subjects, including Afro-Americans and Afro-Africans and 
      in 251 Afro-Africans participants with severe malaria. RESULTS: The frequencies
      of the 776G allele were the highest in China (0.607; 95% CI 0.554 to 0.659), low 
      in West Africa (Benin and Togo, 0.178; 0.154 to 0.206), and intermediate in
      France (0.445; 0.408 to 0.481), Italy (0.352; 0.299 to 0.409), Morocco (0.370;
      0.300 to 0.447) and Mexico (0.374; 0.392 to 0.419). The 776G genotype was more
      frequent in Afro-Americans from New York (16.7; 8.4 to 30.7) and in Afro-African 
      patients with severe malaria (6.0%; 95% CI 3.7 to 9.6) than in healthy
      Afro-African volunteers (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.033, respectively), while no
      difference was observed for MTHFR 677TT and 677T alleles. A disequilibrium of
      TCN2 genotype distribution was recorded in patients with severe malaria, with a
      twofold higher GG genotype than expected (p = 0.010). An association between the 
      TCN2 polymorphism and homocysteine was observed only in Mexico and France, the
      two countries with the highest rate of low plasma concentration of vitamin B(12) 
      (<100 pmol/l). CONCLUSION: Given the dramatic heterogeneity of the 776G allele
      frequency worldwide, this polymorphism may be prone to a selective pressure or
      confers an evolutionary advantage in confronting environmental factors, one of
      which is malaria.

TI  - No variation in the prevalence of point mutations in the Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes
      in isolates from Gabonese patients with uncomplicated or severe Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria.
PG  - 487-93
AB  - In Lambarene (Gabon), where a high level of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to
      chloroquine has been reported, we assessed the relationship between polymorphisms
      in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) and multidrug
      resistance-1 (Pfmdr1) genes and the clinical severity of malaria. Ninety-one and 
      60 P. falciparum isolates from children with uncomplicated or severe malaria were
      collected in 1996 and 2002, respectively. Single nucleotide mutations at codon 76
      in the Pfcrt gene and at codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246 in the Pfmdr1 gene 
      were assessed by PCR-RFLP. All P. falciparum isolates presented the Pfcrt K76T
      mutation, whatever the clinical status. A high prevalence (>80%) of the Pfmdr1
      86Tyr and 184Phe mutations was detected at both time points and in both clinical 
      groups. We did not identify any specific mutation in the Pfmdr1 gene associated
      with the severity of disease, and the multiplicity of P. falciparum infection was
      also similar in both groups. Our results showed no change in the polymorphism of 
      Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes in P. falciparum isolates collected in 1996 and 2002, and 
      the severity of the disease was not associated with specific mutations neither in
      the Pfcrt nor in the Pfmdr1 genes in the study site.

PG  - 166-70
AB  - The clinical presentation of malaria mainly the severe form may be related to
      Plasmodium falciparum msp-2 (merozoite surface protein 2) specific family To
      verify this hypothesis, during the high malaria transmission season in 2001; we
      analyzed the allelic polymorphism of the msp-2 gene of P. falciparum in children 
      under 5 years old with different presentation of malaria in the regional Hospital
      and at community level in the Boulgou Province (Burkina Faso). A total of 405
      children (107 severe malarial anaemia cases, 102 severe malaria cases without
      severe anaemia and 196 non severe malaria cases) were enrolled in the study. The 
      frequencies of the FC27 were 89.2% in severe malarial anaemia children group,
      then 89.7% and 86.9% respectively in severe malaria non anaemic children cases
      and non severe malaria cases (P = 0.4). The frequencies of the 3D7 were 72.5%;
      84.1% and 77% respectively severe malaria non anaemic children, severe malarial
      anaemia cases and non severe malaria cases (P = 0.7). The complexity of the FC27 
      genotypes was significantly higher in children with severe malaria (with and
      without severe anaemia) compared to the non severe malarial children (P <<
      0.001). No significant difference was pointed up in the complexity of the 3D7
      genotypes.

TI  - Red blood cell polymorphisms in relation to Plasmodium falciparum asymptomatic
      parasite densities and morbidity in Senegal.
PG  - 2352-8
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that several red blood cell polymorphisms protect
      against severe malaria. Such a relation is much less clear for mild malaria
      attacks and for the asymptomatic carriage of Plasmodium falciparum. The impact of
      red blood cell polymorphisms on the level of parasite density was assessed in a
      group of 464 Senegalese children from the Sereer ethnic group, studied for 18
      months. These genetic factors were also related to the malarial morbidity,
      investigated during 2 successive transmission seasons among 169 of these
      children. The frequencies of the host genetic factors in the whole group were
      0.52 for blood group O, 0.13 for hemoglobin S, 0.16 for the G6PD A-deficient
      variant and 0.24 for alpha+-thalassemia (-alpha(3.7) deletion). Hemoglobin S was 
      associated with protection against mild malaria attacks. None of the genetic
      factors was implicated in a better control of parasite densities. These
      associations may be particular to this ethnic group due to the specificities of
      malaria endemicity in this area. The pressure exerted in the area by other
      non-malarial infectious diseases as well as the genetic heterogeneity of
      circulating parasites may also contribute to these observations.

TI  - Urban malaria in Dakar, Senegal: chemosusceptibility and genetic diversity of
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates.
PG  - 146-51
AB  - The chemosusceptibility and genetic polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparum
      populations from 48 patients hospitalized for malaria at the Hospital Principal
      in Dakar, Senegal were investigated during the 2002 malaria transmission season. 
      Sixty-two percent of the isolates collected were from patients with severe
      malaria and 38% were from patients with mild malaria. In vitro activities of
      chloroquine, quinine, cycloguanil, atovaquone, mefloquine, halofantrine, and
      artesunate were evaluated. The prevalence of mutations in the Plasmodium
      falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihyropteroate synthetase (dhps)
      genes and the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene
      associated with cycloguanil, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and chloroquine
      resistance were estimated. The genetic polymorphism of the parasite populations
      was evaluated by analysis of the highly polymorphic regions of merozoite surface 
      protein 1 (msp1) block 2 and msp2. Seventy percent of the isolates were assessed 
      by an in vitro assay. Fifty-two percent of the isolates were chloroquine
      resistant, 45% were cycloguanil resistant, and 24% were atovaquone resistant.
      Four percent had low susceptibility to quinine. The Pfcrt and dhfr mutations were
      associated with in vitro chloroquine- and antimetabolic drug-resistant isolates, 
      respectively. Approximately 70% of the isolates contained two or more clones.
      Genetic diversity of P. falciparum was high. The prevalence of allelic family K1 
      of msp1 was 68%. Isolates of P. falciparum were highly resistant to chloroquine, 
      cycloguanil and atovaquone. The transmission rate of malaria in Dakar is low but 
      a high degree of genetic polymorphism can increase severe malaria, as shown by
      persons coming to Dakar from areas highly endemic for malaria. Areas with urban
      malaria should use vector control measures and efficient chemoprophylaxis for
      non-immune populations.

TI  - Association of a new mannose-binding lectin variant with severe malaria in
      Gabonese children.
PG  - 393-400
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL2) variants that decrease the plasma level of the
      protein or encode dysfunctional proteins are frequently associated with the
      severity of a number of infections and autoimmune disorders. The high frequencies
      of these variants in most populations of the world are probably maintained by
      some selective advantage against widespread diseases. We found 14 new MBL2
      allelic haplotypes, two of them with non-synonymous variants, by screening 136
      children with uncomplicated malaria, 131 children with severe malaria and 39
      older healthy schoolchildren. We also found a significant association of a novel 
      variant with susceptibility to severe malaria (P=0.010). Increased MBL plasma
      levels and corresponding MBL2 genotypes were associated with lower concentration 
      of several cytokines and chemokines in plasma of malaria patients. We suggest
      that malaria could have been one of the evolutionary driving forces shaping the
      MBL2 polymorphism in the African population.

TI  - Association of FCgamma receptor IIA (CD32) polymorphism with malarial anemia and 
      high-density parasitemia in infants and young children.
PG  - 573-7
AB  - Protective immunity against Plasmodium falciparum is partially mediated through
      binding of malaria-specific IgG antibodies to Fcgamma receptors. Polymorphic
      variability in Fcgamma RIIa (H/R-131) is associated with differential binding of 
      IgG subtypes and malaria disease outcomes. However, the role of Fcgamma RIIa-131 
      variability in conditioning susceptibility to severe malarial anemia, the primary
      manifestation of severe malaria in holoendemic P. falciparum transmission areas, 
      is largely undefined. Thus, Fcgamma RIIa-H131R polymorphism was investigated in
      493 children who came to a hospital with acute malaria. Variation in Fcgamma
      RIIa-131 was not significantly associated with severe malarial anemia (hemoglobin
      [Hb] < 6.0 g/dL) or malaria anemia (Hb < 8.0 g/dL). However, relative to the
      heterozygous genotype, homozygotes for the R131 alleles were protected against
      high-density parasitemia (>or= 10,000 parasites/microL; odds ratio [OR] = 0.58,
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37-0.92, P = 0.02), while homozygotes for the
      H131 alleles were mildly protective (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.45-1.13, P = 0.14).
      Additional multivariate analyses showed that infection with human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 did not influence the associations between
      FcgammaRIIa-H131R polymorphism and malaria disease outcomes. Genotypic results
      presented here parallel data illustrating that parasite density is unrelated to
      the severity of anemia in children with acute malaria. Thus, although
      homozygosity for the R131 allele protects against high-density parasitemia,
      FcgammaRIIa-131 polymorphism does not protect against malaria anemia.

TI  - Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms in African children: Common TLR-4 variants
      predispose to severe malaria.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Genetic host factors play a substantial role in susceptibility to and severity of
      malaria, which continues to cause at least one million deaths per year. Recently,
      members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family have been shown to be involved in 
      recognition of the etiologic organism Plasmodium falciparum: The
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor induces signaling in host cells via TLR-2 and
      -4, whereas hemozoin-induced immune activation involves TLR-9. Binding of
      microbial ligands to the respective TLRs triggers the release of proinflammatory 
      cytokines via the TLR/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain and may contribute to the host
      response in malaria, including cytokine induction and fever. In a case-control
      study among 870 Ghanaian children, we examined the influence of TLR-2, -4, and -9
      polymorphisms in susceptibility to severe malaria. TLR-2 variants common in
      Caucasians and Asians were completely absent. However, we found a rare previously
      undescribed mutation (Leu658Pro), which impairs signaling via TLR-2. We failed to
      detect any polymorphisms within the TLR-9 Toll/IL-1 receptor domain. Two frequent
      TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms did not show a clear association with malaria
      severity. In contrast, the TLR-4-Asp299Gly variant occurred at a high rate of
      17.6% in healthy controls and was even more frequent in severe malaria patients
      (24.1%, P < 0.05). Likewise, TLR-4-Thr399Ile was seen in 2.4% of healthy children
      and in 6.2% of patients (P = 0.02). TLR-4-Asp299Gly and TLR-4-Thr399Ile conferred
      1.5- and 2.6-fold increased risks of severe malaria, respectively. These findings
      suggest TLR4-mediated responses to malaria in vivo and TLR-4 polymorphisms to be 
      associated with disease manifestation.

TI  - Distribution of IgG subclass antibodies specific for Plasmodium falciparum
      glutamate-rich-protein molecule in sickle cell trait children with asymptomatic
      infections.
PG  - 92-8
AB  - Polymorphism in the beta-globin gene (hemoglobin S) has been associated with
      protection against severe forms of malaria. In a cross-sectional study, 180 young
      Gabonese children with and without sickle cell trait and harboring asymptomatic
      Plasmodium falciparum infections, were assessed for the responses to recombinant 
      protein containing the conserved region of glutamate-rich protein (GLURP). We
      reported increased age-dependence of antibody prevalence and levels of total IgG 
      (p<0.0001), IgG1 (p=0.009), and IgG3 (p<0.03) antibodies to GLURP with a cut-off 
      at 5 years of age. Whatever the hemoglobin type, cytophilic antibodies (IgG1 and 
      IgG3) were prevalent, but GLURP-specific IgG4 antibodies were detected at
      significantly (p<0.05) lower levels in HbAS children. We showed that the
      distribution of non-cytophilic IgG antibodies differs according to the hemoglobin
      type and to the malaria antigens tested. This may have possible implication for
      the clearance of malaria parasites and for protection against severe malaria.

TI  - Complement receptor 1 polymorphisms associated with resistance to severe malaria 
      in Kenya.
PG  - 54
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that the African alleles Sl2 and McCb of the
      Swain-Langley (Sl) and McCoy (McC) blood group antigens of the complement
      receptor 1 (CR1) may confer a survival advantage in the setting of Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria, but this has not been demonstrated. METHODS: To test this
      hypothesis, children in western Kenya with severe malaria-associated anaemia or
      cerebral malaria were matched to symptomatic uncomplicated malaria controls by
      age and gender. Swain-Langley and McCoy blood group alleles were determined by
      restriction fragment length polymorphism and conditional logistic regression was 
      carried out. RESULTS: No significant association was found between the African
      alleles and severe malaria-associated anaemia. However, children with Sl2/2
      genotype were less likely to have cerebral malaria (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to
      0.72, P = 0.02) than children with Sl1/1. In particular, individuals with Sl2/2
      McC(a/b) genotype were less likely to have cerebral malaria (OR = 0.18, 95% CI
      0.04 to 0.77, P = 0.02) than individuals with Sl1/1 McC(a/a). CONCLUSION: These
      results support the hypothesis that the Sl2 allele and, possibly, the McCb allele
      evolved in the context of malaria transmission and that in certain combinations
      probably confer a survival advantage on these populations.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria in south-west Nigerian children: is the
      polymorphism of ICAM-1 and E-selectin genes contributing to the clinical severity
      of malaria?
PG  - 248-55
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major public health hazard in sub-Saharan
      African children. While the factors that determine the variations in clinical
      outcome of a malaria have not been completely defined, both host and parasite
      factors, as well as the complex molecular interactions between them have been
      implicated. The cyto-adherent properties of the P. falciparum-infected red blood 
      cells are considered as key properties in the pathogenesis of malaria and the
      polymorphisms of the host adhesion molecules could contribute to the severity of 
      malaria. Clinical information and blood samples were collected from 223 children 
      from Ibadan (south-west Nigeria), median age of 34.5 months, presenting with
      different clinical manifestations of malaria--clinically asymptomatic parasitism 
      (ACP), acute uncomplicated malaria (UM) and severe malaria (SM)--as defined by
      WHO criteria. The polymorphisms of genes coding for four human adhesion molecules
      at six different loci (ICAM-1 exons 2, 4 and 6, E-selectin exon 2, CD36 exon 10, 
      and PECAM exon 3) were studied. DNA samples were prepared for further genotyping 
      of the six exons mentioned above by PCR-RFLPs using the appropriate restriction
      digests for each loci. The ICAM-1 exon 4 locus was monomorphic. All the other
      loci were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The E-selectin locus had very low 
      heterozygosity (approximately 0.06) in contrast to the other loci under study
      (0.23-0.44). Once the data was further processed for covariates (age and parasite
      density) and taking as the reference category the ACP group, results show that in
      the presence of the G allele at the ICAM-1 exon 6 there is an increased risk (3.6
      times) of severe malaria. As far as the T allele in the E-selectin exon is
      concerned, the number of sampled DNAs with the T allele within both the UM and SM
      categories is too low for drawing any relevant conclusion at this stage. In
      conclusion, these results suggest that genetic polymorphisms at host adhesion
      molecules loci are an important variable in the susceptibility to severe malaria.
      Further studies of host loci are needed to further delineate which polymorphisms 
      are associated with severe malaria and increase our knowledge of the biology of
      host-parasite interactions.

TI  - Age-dependent effect of plasma nitric oxide on parasite density in Ghanaian
      children with severe malaria.
PG  - 672-80
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) has toxic properties against Plasmodium falciparum. While high 
      blood levels have been associated with protection against severe malarial
      disease, they may also contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral malaria and 
      severe anaemia. Promoter variants in the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
      gene have been shown to influence NO concentrations and disease manifestation.
      However, findings are conflicting. We examined associations of plasma NO
      metabolites (NOx) with symptoms of severe malaria, particularly malarial anaemia 
      and cerebral malaria, and with iNOS promoter variants. In 210 Ghanaian children
      with severe malaria, we measured plasma nitrite, nitrate, and S-nitrosothiol, and
      genotyped the iNOS promoter variants -954G-->C, -1173C-->T, and the -2.5 kb
      (CCTTT)(n) microsatellite. NOx levels decreased with age. In young children (<24 
      months), high NOx was associated with reduced parasite density. This was not seen
      in patients of 24-48 months of age and reversed in older children. Subgroup
      analysis revealed that in children with severe anaemia but without cerebral
      involvement (prostration, impaired consciousness, convulsions), high NOx levels
      correlated with low parasitaemia (P = 0.02). In these children, elevated NOx
      levels were also associated with the iNOS-954C-->T/(CCTTT)(8) haplotype (P =
      0.03). No association between NOx or iNOS genotypes and cerebral malaria was
      observed. Our findings suggest that in young children with severe malaria NOx
      reduces parasitaemia. This effect wanes at higher ages and may reflect a
      predominance of unspecific immune responses to infection in early childhood. This
      finding may have importance for the understanding of associations between iNOS
      variants and severe malaria in regions of differing disease manifestation.

TI  - Limited influence of haptoglobin genotypes on severe malaria in Ghanaian
      children.
PG  - 668-71
AB  - Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphisms in sub-Saharan Africa have been associated with an
      increased risk of severe malaria. However, available data are inconclusive. We
      examined the role of Hp polymorphisms in susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum 
      infection and to severe malaria in northern Ghana. Three groups each of 290 age
      and sex-matched children with severe malaria, children with asymptomatic P.
      falciparum infection and aparasitaemic healthy controls were studied. Hp typing
      was based on PCR. In all children, Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2 occurred in 32.4%,
      54.1%, and 13.5%, respectively. The prevalence of the Hp genotypes did not differ
      significantly between groups. However, Hp2 alleles were least common in healthy
      children (0.379), more frequent in parasitaemic controls (0.402), and most common
      in severe malaria patients (0.434; = 3.7; P = 0.06). In matched pair analysis, no
      Hp genotype increased the risk of severe malaria. However, using Hp1-1 as a
      reference, children with Hp2-2 exhibited a slightly increased risk of severe
      malaria (odds ratio, 1.6; P = 0.04). These results indicate that Hp polymorhisms 
      may have a rather limited influence on the development of severe malaria.

TI  - Analysis of IL10 haplotypic associations with severe malaria.
PG  - 462-6
AB  - We investigated the association between severe malaria and genetic variation of
      IL10 in Gambian children, as several lines of evidence indicate that IL10 is
      protective against severe malaria and that IL10 production is genetically
      determined. We began by identifying five informative SNPs in the Gambian
      population that were genotyped in a combined case-control and intrafamilial study
      including 654 cases of severe malaria, 579 sets of parents and 459 ethnically
      matched controls. No significant associations were identified with individual
      SNPs. One haplotype of frequency 0.11 was strongly associated with protection
      against severe malaria in the case-control analysis (odds ratio 0.52, P=0.00002),
      but the transmission disequilibrium test in families showed no significant
      effect. These findings raise the question of whether IL10 associations with
      severe malaria might be confounded by foetal survival rates or other sources of
      transmission bias.

TI  - Investigation of malaria susceptibility determinants in the IFNG/IL26/IL22
      genomic region.
PG  - 312-8
AB  - Interferon-gamma, encoded by IFNG, is a key immunological mediator that is
      believed to play both a protective and a pathological role in malaria. Here, we
      investigate the relationship between IFNG variation and susceptibility to
      malaria. We began by analysing West African and European haplotype structure and 
      patterns of linkage disequilibrium across a 100 kb genomic region encompassing
      IFNG and its immediate neighbours IL22 and IL26. A large case-control study of
      severe malaria in a West Africa population identified several weak associations
      with individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IFNG and IL22 genes, and
      defined two IL22 haplotypes that are, respectively, associated with resistance
      and susceptibility. These data provide a starting point for functional and
      genetic analysis of the IFNG genomic region in malaria and other infectious and
      inflammatory conditions affecting African populations.

TI  - Genetic study of ICAM1 in clinical malaria in Senegal.
PG  - 474-80
AB  - Many genes have been implicated in the risk of severe malaria, generally based on
      candidate gene studies in case/control populations. Among these genes, there has 
      been conflicting reports for the implication of a variant of the intercellular
      adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), ICAM1(Kilifi), in the risk of severe malaria, while 
      in vitro studies provided independent support for a functional role of this
      variant. In order to explore the possible implication of ICAM1 in the
      susceptibility/resistance to malaria and to try to understand its clinical
      relevance in the disease process, we have conducted linkage and association
      studies of ICAM1 in two Senegalese villages located in regions of endemic
      malaria. We explored the full genetic variability of ICAM1, and tested it on
      several clinical malarial traits which are under genetic control, focusing
      principally on variables related to the parasite density and the number of
      malarial attacks. Our study provides no evidence for a role of ICAM1 variability 
      on the malarial phenotypes studied.

      children with different manifestations of malaria.
PG  - 7-11
AB  - The distribution of gene variants of the antigen processing proteins transporter 
      associated with antigen processing type 1 (TAP1) and proteasome subunit beta type
      9 (PSMB9) and of their shared bidirectional promoter was assessed in children
      with either mild or severe malaria. The genetic study was performed on samples
      collected during a longitudinal study on malariometric indices in an area
      hyperendemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon. The allele frequencies
      of the genes did not differ between the mild and the severe malaria groups. The
      distributions of alleles among children with distinct phenotypes of severe
      malaria were similar. A negative association of hypoglycaemia with the PSMB9
      promoter variant PSMB9-R was found (odds ratio 0.01; chi2=12.1; P<0.0005;
      Pc<0.03). The promoter allele TAP1-446G was associated with hyperparasitaemia and
      absence of hypoglycaemia. TAP1, PSMB9, and TAP1/PSMB9 promoter alleles were in
      strong linkage disequilibrium. DNA sequencing of the TAP1/PSMB9 promoter region
      revealed a previously unrecognized single nucleotide polymorphism 455 bp upstream
      of the TAP1 transcription start site.

TI  - Allelic polymorphisms in the repeat and promoter regions of the interleukin-4
      gene and malaria severity in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Immunoglobulin E has been associated with severe malaria suggesting a regulatory 
      role for interleukin (IL)-4 and/or IgE in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. We 
      have investigated possible associations between polymorphisms in the IL-4 repeat 
      region (intron 3) and promoter regions (IL-4 +33CT and - 590CT) in Ghanaian
      children with severe malaria. There was a significantly higher frequency of IL-4 
      intron-3 B1B1 genotype in the cerebral malaria group [P < 0.0001, odds ratio (OR)
      = 8.7]. The genotype and allele frequencies of the IL-4 -590 and +33
      polymorphisms did not differ between the four study groups. Carriers of IL-4
      +33T/-590T with cerebral malaria had elevated total IgE compared to non-carriers 
      (P = 0.03). Our data suggest that IL-4 and/or IgE play a regulatory role in the
      pathogenesis of severe or complicated malaria.

TI  - DNA phasing by TA dinucleotide microsatellite length determines in vitro and in
      vivo expression of the gp91phox subunit of NADPH oxidase and mediates protection 
      against severe malaria.
PG  - 2227-34
AB  - Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a major role in the nonspecific innate 
      immune response to invading microorganisms, such as Plasmodium falciparum. In a
      search for genetic markers that determine differences in production of ROI, we
      detected a highly polymorphic region of dinucleotide TA repeats approximately 550
      bp upstream of the NADPH oxidase gp91(phox) subunit promoter. We genotyped 183
      matched Gabonese children with severe or mild malaria. Repeat lengths TA(11) and 
      TA(16) differed significantly in frequency between mild and severe infection,
      which suggests protection against severe malaria. Both repeat lengths showed
      lower levels of NADPH oxidase and promoter activities, which can be explained by 
      a cyclic trend in TA repeat length with a period of approximately 5, which
      indicates the necessity of correct DNA phasing between 2 possible control regions
      in the promoter. We provide a molecular model of how DNA phasing generated by TA 
      dinucleotide polymorphisms may influence the expression level and protect against
      severe malaria.

TI  - IL4-589C/T polymorphism and IgE levels in severe malaria.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Previous studies identified an allelic variant of the IL4 promoter region
      (IL4-589T) that appears to enhance the transcriptional activity of IL4, and is
      associated with increased IgE levels. Total serum IgE levels are elevated in
      malaria endemic regions, and higher in children with severe malaria. Here, we
      investigated the relationship of the IL4-589C/T polymorphism with severity of the
      disease in a case-control study of severe malaria in Burkina Faso, West Africa.
      No association between the IL4-589T and severe malaria was observed. No
      difference in Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgE was detected between severe and 
      uncomplicated malaria patients. Among children with severe malaria, total IgE
      levels were significantly elevated in those carrying the IL4-589T allele (P =
      0.018). In children with uncomplicated malaria, no significant difference was
      found. These results raise the possibility that there is a relationship between
      susceptibility to severe malaria, IgE production and genetic variation in the IL4
      region, which merits further investigation in other epidemiological settings.

TI  - Association of Fcgamma receptor IIa (CD32) polymorphism with severe malaria in
      West Africa.
PG  - 565-8
AB  - Malaria continues to claim the lives of more children worldwide than any other
      infectious disease, and improved understanding of disease immunology is a
      priority for the development of new therapeutic and vaccination strategies.
      FcgammaRIIa (CD32) contains a polymorphic variant (H/R131) that has been
      associated with variability in susceptibility to both bacterial diseases and
      Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia. We investigated the role of this polymorphism 
      in West Africans with mild and severe malarial disease. The HH131 genotype was
      significantly associated with susceptibility to severe malaria (P = 0.03, odds
      ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.91). In contrast to studies of
      parasitemia, the presence of the R131 allele, rather than the RR131 genotype,
      appeared to be the important factor in protection from disease. This is the first
      evidence for an association between CD32 polymorphism and severe malaria and
      provides an example of balancing selective pressures from different infectious
      diseases operating at the same genetic locus.

TI  - Interleukin-1 gene cluster polymorphisms and susceptibility to clinical malaria
      in a Gambian case-control study.
PG  - 132-8
AB  - Interleukin-1 (IL1) is a potent endogenous pyrogen and inducer of the acute phase
      response, and these innate immune responses are an important part of the human
      host's initial reaction to infection by the malaria parasite. In addition,
      several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region have previously
      been demonstrated to be associated with susceptibility to infectious disease.
      Therefore, a possible association with malaria susceptibility was investigated. A
      total of 13 polymorphic markers were used in a two-stage screening strategy to
      genotype a Gambian case-control study group by either restriction endonuclease
      digestion or the Sequenom MassARRAY assay. This involved an initial screen of 188
      severe cases and 188 mild controls, and if there was a significant association
      with a malaria phenotype (P<0.05); this was followed by screening of the
      remaining 1044 samples. Two markers showed significant association with malaria: 
      interleukin-1 alpha +4845 G --> T (P=0.035 for mild malaria versus controls) and 
      interleukin-1 beta +3953 C --> T (P=0.030 for mild malaria versus severe
      malaria). Haplotypes constructed using the SNPHAP programme were not associated
      with any of the malaria phenotypes investigated. In summary, if IL1 variants are 
      involved in malaria susceptibility in the Gambia at all, then the effects are
      small.

TI  - CR1 Knops blood group alleles are not associated with severe malaria in the
      Gambia.
PG  - 368-73
AB  - The Knops blood group antigen erythrocyte polymorphisms have been associated with
      reduced falciparum malaria-based in vitro rosette formation (putative malaria
      virulence factor). Having previously identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) in the human complement receptor 1 (CR1/CD35) gene underlying the Knops
      antithetical antigens Sl1/Sl2 and McC(a)/McC(b), we have now performed genotype
      comparisons to test associations between these two molecular variants and severe 
      malaria in West African children living in the Gambia. While SNPs associated with
      Sl:2 and McC(b+) were equally distributed among malaria-infected children with
      severe malaria and control children not infected with malaria parasites, high
      allele frequencies for Sl 2 (0.800, 1,365/1,706) and McC(b) (0.385, 658/1706)
      were observed. Further, when compared to the Sl 1/McC(a) allele observed in all
      populations, the African Sl 2/McC(b) allele appears to have evolved as a result
      of positive selection (modified Nei-Gojobori test Ka-Ks/s.e.=1.77, P-value
      <0.05). Given the role of CR1 in host defense, our findings suggest that Sl 2 and
      McC(b) have arisen to confer a selective advantage against infectious disease
      that, in view of these case-control study data, was not solely Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria. Factors underlying the lack of association between Sl 2 and
      McC(b) with severe malaria may involve variation in CR1 expression levels.

TI  - Human genetic polymorphisms and asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      Gabonese schoolchildren.
PG  - 186-90
AB  - Several studies have focused their attention on the relationship between host
      genetic factors and susceptibility/resistance to severe malaria. However, there
      is a paucity of information concerning the role of host genetic factors in
      asymptomatic malaria, a form of low-grade Plasmodium falciparum infection without
      clinical symptoms. We investigated in this study the potential relationship
      between the host (human) genetic polymorphisms (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
      [G6PD], mannose binding lectin [MBL], tumor necrosis factor alpha
      [TNFalpha](-308) and (-238), and nitric oxide synthase 2 [NOS2](-954)) and the
      prevalence and profile of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in 158 Gabonese
      schoolchildren. We found that G6PD A- heterozygous females (18 of 74) have a low 
      prevalence of asymptomatic malaria (38.9% versus 67.3%; P = 0.03, by chi-square
      test). Children heterozygous for TNFalpha(-238) (25 of 156) carry high number of 
      diverse infecting parasite genotypes (2.5 versus 1.99; variance F = 3.05). No
      statistically significant association was found between MBL, TNFalpha(-308), or
      NOS2 polymorphisms and asymptomatic malaria. Upon combining our data on
      asymptomatic forms with those from the literature for others forms, we conclude
      that G6PD A- heterozygous females are protected against all forms of P.
      falciparum malaria, and that the TNFalpha(-238A) allele confers protection
      against clinical malaria.

TI  - Polymorphisms in interleukin-1beta and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist genes
      and malaria in Ghanaian children.
PG  - 619-22
AB  - We have investigated the possible associations between polymorphisms in two
      interleukin-1 (IL-1) genes and severity of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in
      Ghanaian children with cerebral malaria, severe anaemia or uncomplicated malaria 
      and controls. There was no significant difference in genotype and allele
      frequencies in IL-1beta exon 5 or interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra)
      polymorphisms between the studied groups, suggesting that the two polymorphisms
      may not be involved in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. When parasitaemias in 
      uncomplicated malaria patients were evaluated, a significantly higher level of
      parasitaemia was observed among carriers of IL-1beta A2 allele as compared with
      noncarriers of this allele (P = 0.01). The mean parasitaemia in an age-matched
      asymptomatic group did not reveal such associations. These data suggest that
      IL-1beta exon 5 allele 2 may play a possible role in the clinical outcome of
      uncomplicated malaria.

TI  - A new NOS2 promoter polymorphism associated with increased nitric oxide
      production and protection from severe malaria in Tanzanian and Kenyan children.
PG  - 1468-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of immunity to malaria, and genetic
      polymorphisms in the promoter of the inducible NO synthase gene (NOS2) could
      modulate production of NO. We postulated that NOS2 promoter polymorphisms would
      affect resistance to severe malaria. METHODS: We assessed genomic DNA from
      healthy children and from those diagnosed with malaria from Tanzania (n=47 and
      n=138, respectively) and Kenya (n=1106) for polymorphisms by single-stranded
      conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. We also measured
      in-vivo NO production in Tanzanian children. FINDINGS: We identified a novel
      single nucleotide polymorphism, -1173 C-->T, in the NOS2 promoter that was
      significantly associated with protection from symptomatic malaria (odds ratio
      0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.48, p=0.0006) in 179 Tanzanian children, and significantly
      associated with protection from severe malarial anaemia (adjusted relative risk
      0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.66, p=0.0005) in 1106 Kenyan children studied over 5 years.
      The risk of parasitaemia was not significantly different in wild-type or -1173
      C-->T individuals. -1173 C-->T protection in Tanzanians was independent of the
      previously recognised NOS2-954 G-->C polymorphism. The (CCTTT)(n) NOS2
      polymorphism (Tanzania and Kenya) was not associated with severe malaria
      outcomes. -1173 C-->T was associated with increased fasting urine and plasma NO
      metabolite concentrations in Tanzanian children, suggesting that the polymorphism
      was functional in vivo. Interpretation The NOS2 promoter -1173 C-->T single
      nucleotide polymorphism is associated with protection against cerebral malaria
      and severe malarial anaemia. Increased NO production in individuals with the
      -1173 C-->T polymorphism lends support to a protective role for NO against these 
      syndromes. Targeted interventions to increase NO delivery or production could
      provide novel preventive and therapeutic strategies against these major causes of
      mortality in African children.

TI  - A promoter polymorphism in the gene encoding interleukin-12 p40 (IL12B) is
      associated with mortality from cerebral malaria and with reduced nitric oxide
      production.
PG  - 414-8
AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important regulatory cytokine in infection and
      immunity. Administration of IL-12 may reduce complications of severe malaria in
      rodents. Polymorphisms in IL12B, the gene encoding the IL-12 p40 subunit,
      influence the secretion of IL-12 and susceptibility to Type 1 diabetes. We
      therefore investigated whether IL12B polymorphisms may affect the outcome of
      severe malaria. Homozygosity for a polymorphism in the IL12B promoter was
      associated with increased mortality in Tanzanian children having cerebral malaria
      but not in Kenyan children with severe malaria. Furthermore, homozygotes for the 
      IL12B promotor polymorphism had decreased production of nitric oxide, which is in
      part regulated by IL-12 activity. These studies suggest that IL12B polymorphisms,
      via regulation of IL-12 production, may influence the outcome of malaria
      infection in at least one African population.

TI  - Evidence for balancing selection from nucleotide sequence analyses of human G6PD.
PG  - 1112-28
AB  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mutations that result in reduced enzyme 
      activity have been implicated in malarial resistance and constitute one of the
      best examples of selection in the human genome. In the present study, we
      characterize the nucleotide diversity across a 5.2-kb region of G6PD in a sample 
      of 160 Africans and 56 non-Africans, to determine how selection has shaped
      patterns of DNA variation at this gene. Our global sample of enzymatically normal
      B alleles and A, A-, and Med alleles with reduced enzyme activities reveals many 
      previously uncharacterized silent-site polymorphisms. In comparison with the
      absence of amino acid divergence between human and chimpanzee G6PD sequences, we 
      find that the number of G6PD amino acid polymorphisms in human populations is
      significantly high. Unlike many other G6PD-activity alleles with reduced
      activity, we find that the age of the A variant, which is common in Africa, may
      not be consistent with the recent emergence of severe malaria and therefore may
      have originally had a historically different adaptive function. Overall, our
      observations strongly support previous genotype-phenotype association studies
      that proposed that balancing selection maintains G6PD deficiencies within human
      populations. The present study demonstrates that nucleotide sequence analyses can
      reveal signatures of both historical and recent selection in the genome and may
      elucidate the impact that infectious disease has had during human evolution.

TI  - IFNGR1 gene promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to cerebral malaria.
PG  - 1684-7
AB  - Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a critical mediator of immunity to malaria. This study 
      explored the relationship between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the
      gene encoding IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and susceptibility to malaria in
      African children. Four polymorphisms were found in the region between -1400 and
      +100 nt of the translational start site by sequencing, and analysis of 562
      nuclear families revealed 6 haplotypes. Case-control analysis of 562 Gambian
      children with severe malaria and 569 umbilical cord blood samples (controls)
      showed that in Mandinka, the major Gambian ethnic group, heterozygotes for the
      IFNGR1-56 polymorphism were protected against cerebral malaria (odds ratio, 0.54;
      P=.016) and against death resulting from cerebral malaria (odds ratio, 0.22;
      P=.006). Analysis of a family study by transmission disequilibrium testing
      revealed a similar result. Further data are needed to validate this finding, but 
      these results are reminiscent of those for other well-established heterozygote
      advantages, such as that associated with hemoglobin S.

      haplotypes in The Gambia.
PG  - 894-9
AB  - Previous work has shown that a single haplotype of the T-cell antigen receptor
      beta-subunit (TCRB) locus is predominant in African populations. This is likely
      to be due to selection pressure for gene(s) that protect children against
      disease. This study has tested the hypothesis that malaria is the responsible
      selection pressure, due to its impact on child mortality. The haplotypes of
      BV8S3, BV2S1, BV15S1, and BV3S1 were determined in children suffering from severe
      malaria and unaffected adult controls. No significant difference between cases
      and controls was shown for any of the haplotypes studied. In addition, an
      insertion/deletion (INDEL) haplotype in the 5' region of the TCRB locus was
      investigated. Again no differences between the two groups were detected.
      Therefore, the evidence suggests that malaria is not responsible for haplotype
      selection in The Gambia.

TI  - Short report: codon 125 polymorphism of CD31 and susceptibility to malaria.
PG  - 736-7
AB  - Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1/CD31) has been identified 
      as an endothelial cell receptor of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
      The significance of adhesion of infected erythrocytes to this receptor in malaria
      infection has not been determined. We have therefore studied the association of
      the functional mutation CTG-->GTG (Leu-->Val) in codon 125 of the Cd31 gene with 
      severe disease in 2 case-control studies of malaria in Madang Hospital, Papua New
      Guinea, and in Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya. We analyzed data from 442 cases
      and controls from Papua New Guinea and data from 396 cases and controls from
      Kenya. The codon 125 polymorphism was not associated with severe malaria in
      either study. We conclude that the presence of CTG-->GTG (Leu-->Val) substitution
      in codon 125 in CD31 is not associated with protection from severe malaria, and
      we suggest that selective forces other than malaria may maintain this
      high-frequency polymorphism.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum in Kenya: high prevalence of drug-resistance-associated
      polymorphisms in hospital admissions with severe malaria in an epidemic area.
PG  - 661-9
AB  - During an epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Chogoria, Kenya, P.
      falciparum DNA was collected from 24 cases of severe malaria admitted to hospital
      for parenteral quinine treatment. These patients had all failed first-
      (chloroquine) and second-line (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine) drug
      treatments. Twenty-two (92%) of the 24 patients sampled carried parasites with
      the (Asn)86(Tyr) point mutation in the pfmdr1 gene (chromosome 5), 20 (83%) had
      an (Asp)1246(Tyr) mutation and 18 (82%) had both of these mutations. These
      alleles are both reported to be associated with chloroquine-resistance.
      Polymorphisms in the cg2 gene (chromosome 7) are also associated with chloroquine
      resistance, and 18 (75%) of the 24 parasite samples each had the cg2 and pfmdr1
      polymorphisms. These 18 samples also had the mutations associated with resistance
      to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine: (Asn)51(Ile), (Cys)59(Arg) and (Ser)108(Asn) of
      gene dhfr (chromosome 4) and (Ala)437(Gly) and (Lys)540(Glu) of dhps (chromosome 
      8), respectively. Genotyping of the parasites from all 24 patients revealed
      extensive diversity in the sequences for the merozoite surface antigens (MSA-1
      and MSA-2) and the glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) and indicated that each sample 
      contained more than one parasite clone. Although samples from non-admitted
      malaria cases were not available, it appears that drug resistance may have played
      an important role in the development of severe malaria in this epidemic.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter variant 2 (TNF2) is associated with pre-term
      delivery, infant mortality, and malaria morbidity in western Kenya: Asembo Bay
      Cohort Project IX.
PG  - 201-11
AB  - A polymorphism in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha) gene, with a guanine to adenine nucleotide change at position -308,
      TNF2 is associated with increased TNF-alpha production. TNF2 homozygotes have a
      higher risk of severe disease and/or death due to cerebral malaria and other
      infectious diseases. We investigated the impact of this allele on malaria
      morbidity and mortality in young children who participated in an
      immuno-epidemiologic cohort study of malaria in an area of intense perennial
      Plasmodium falciparum transmission in western Kenya. A total of 1,048 children
      were genotyped. Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used 
      to determine the relationship between TNF-308 variants and morbidity and
      mortality. The gene frequencies of the TNF1 and TNF2 alleles were 0.90 and 0.10, 
      respectively. TNF2 homozygosity was associated with pre-term birth when compared 
      with TNF1 homozygotes [relative risk (RR) 7.3, 95% CI, 2.85-18.9, P = 0.002) and 
      heterozygotes (RR 6.7, 95% CI 2.0-23.0, P = 0.008). Among children born
      prematurely, the TNF2 allele was significantly associated with a higher risk of
      death in infancy compared with TNF1 (RR 7.47, 95% CI 2.36-23.6). The risk of
      death was higher among TNF2 homozygotes than among heterozygotes. The TNF2 allele
      was significantly associated with high density P. falciparum parasitemia (RR
      1.11, 95% CI 1.0-1.24). Among low birth weight children, the TNF2 allele was
      associated with severe anemia (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.17-4.01) and showed a trend
      toward a risk for severe malaria anemia (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.89-4.46). These data
      suggest that TNF2 is a risk factor for pre-term birth and early childhood
      mortality and malaria morbidity in children in this region. Further understanding
      of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this association is required.

PG  - 330-6
AB  - A point mutation in the promoter of the nitric oxide synthase 2 gene (NOS2),
      termed NOS2(Lambarene) (NOS2-G954C), protects heterozygous carriers against
      severe malaria as effectively as the sickle cell trait. In a prospective
      longitudinal study, 841 individual infections of initially 200 children (151
      wild-type vs. 49 NOS2(Lambarene) carriers) were monitored for 4 years, to assess 
      the rates of malarial attacks in the 2 groups; carriers of the NOS2(Lambarene)
      polymorphism were significantly less likely to experience malarial attacks than
      were others (P=.002). The distribution of the NOS2(Lambarene) polymorphism was
      investigated in malaria-endemic areas. It was found to be present with the
      highest frequency in Africa and at a lower frequency in Asia. Ex vivo studies
      showed that cells isolated from people with this polymorphism have a 7-fold
      higher baseline NOS activity, compared with the levels detected in cells from
      subjects with the wild-type gene (P=.003).

TI  - A polymorphism that affects OCT-1 binding to the TNF promoter region is
      associated with severe malaria.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Genetic variation in cytokine promoter regions is postulated to influence
      susceptibility to infection, but the molecular mechanisms by which such
      polymorphisms might affect gene regulation are unknown. Through systematic DNA
      footprinting of the TNF (encoding tumour necrosis factor, TNF) promoter region,
      we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that causes the
      helix-turn-helix transcription factor OCT-1 to bind to a novel region of complex 
      protein-DNA interactions and alters gene expression in human monocytes. The
      OCT-1-binding genotype, found in approximately 5% of Africans, is associated with
      fourfold increased susceptibility to cerebral malaria in large case-control
      studies of West African and East African populations, after correction for other 
      known TNF polymorphisms and linked HLA alleles.

PG  - 312-6
AB  - Many genes have been shown to be involved in host susceptibility to the severe
      forms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria but it is likely that a large number of
      malaria-susceptibility genes remain to be determined. We conducted a large
      case-control study of children with the severe forms of this disease-cerebral
      malaria and severe malarial anaemia--to attempt to identify these genes. Over
      1200 children in The Gambia were typed for polymorphisms of the intercellular
      adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), complement receptor 1 (CR-1) and interleukin 1
      receptor antagonist (IL-IRA) genes. None of the polymorphisms typed was
      significantly associated with severe disease. These data differed significantly
      from the results of a previous study (Chi 2 = 8.81; P = 0.003) in which the
      ICAM-1 gene polymorphism was shown to be significantly associated with cerebral
      malaria in a case-control study of 547 subjects in Kenya. This suggests that
      there may be heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility to this condition between
      these 2 African populations.

      falciparum malaria.
PG  - 1221-4
AB  - The contribution of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to protection from malaria was
      assessed by comparing plasma concentrations of MBL and the frequency of MBL gene 
      polymorphisms in groups of Gabonese children participating in a prospective study
      of severe and mild malaria due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum. At
      admission, a higher proportion of patients with severe malaria had a low level of
      MBL compared with subjects with mild malaria (0.35 vs. 0.19, P = .02). Two
      mutations in codons 54 and 57 of the MBL gene were detected. They were present at
      higher frequency in those with severe malaria (0.45 vs. 0.31, P = .04). These
      results suggest that deficient innate immune responses, in the form of low MBL
      levels, may be a risk factor for severe malaria in some young children who lack
      well-developed, clinically protective acquired immune responses.

TI  - P. falciparum rosetting mediated by a parasite-variant erythrocyte membrane
      protein and complement-receptor 1.
PG  - 292-5
AB  - The factors determining disease severity in malaria are complex and include host 
      polymorphisms, acquired immunity and parasite virulence. Studies in Africa have
      shown that severe malaria is associated with the ability of erythrocytes infected
      with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum to bind uninfected erythrocytes and form 
      rosettes. The molecular basis of resetting is not well understood, although a
      group of low-molecular-mass proteins called rosettins have been described as
      potential parasite ligands. Infected erythrocytes also bind to endothelial cells,
      and this interaction is mediated by the parasite-derived variant erythrocyte
      membrane protein PfEMP1, which is encoded by the var gene family. Here we report 
      that the parasite ligand for rosetting in a P. falciparum clone is PfEMP1,
      encoded by a specific var gene. We also report that complement-receptor 1 (CR1)
      on erythrocytes plays a role in the formation of rosettes and that erythrocytes
      with a common African CR1 polymorphism (S1(a-)) have reduced adhesion to the
      domain of PfEMP1 that binds normal erythrocytes. Thus we describe a new adhesive 
      function for PfEMP1 and raise the possibility that CR1 polymorphisms in Africans 
      that influence the interaction between erythrocytes and PfEMP1 may protect
      against severe malaria.

TI  - Common west African HLA antigens are associated with protection from severe
      malaria.
PG  - 595-600
AB  - A large case-control study of malaria in West African children shows that a human
      leucocyte class I antigen (HLA-Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype
      (DRB1*1302-DQB1*0501), common in West Africans but rare in other racial groups,
      are independently associated with protection from severe malaria. In this
      population they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the
      sickle-cell haemoglobin variant. These data support the hypothesis that the
      extraordinary polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex genes has evolved 
      primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens.

TI  - Severe malaria and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency: a reappraisal of
      the malaria/G-6-P.D. hypothesis.
PG  - 524-6
AB  - Nigerian children with convulsions and Plasmodium falciparium parasitaemia above 
      100,000/microliter did not show a decreased frequency of
      glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G.-6-P.D.) deficiency. A re-evaluation of
      earlier studies has led to the conclusion that clinical evidence of protection
      against falciparum malaria in G.-6-P.D.-deficient individuals is lacking.
      Evidence for the possible role of malaria in selecting for G.-6-P.D.-deficient
      genes consists solely of the geographical association of high frequencies of
      G.-6-P.D. deficiency with endemic malaria.
