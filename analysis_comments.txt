Action: Save FIDs + IDs of all with problem in separate file, tab delimited (fail-checksex-qc.txt)

After checking heterozygosity rate
- 136 individuals failed

After checking per individual missing rate
- 136 individuals failed

After merging individuals who failed both, sorting and taking uniq
- 157 individuals failed both
